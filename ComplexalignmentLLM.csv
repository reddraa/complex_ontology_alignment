can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","In the GMO ontology, you may have equivalent or similar properties and classes that relate to the main:hasDescription property from the GBO ontology as described. Here's how you can map the components:

Property Type (rdf:type): In GMO, you might have a similar datatype property that describes characteristics or details about an entity. Look for properties that end with Description or Info.

Domain (rdfs:domain): owl:Thing is the most general class in OWL ontologies, encompassing all possible instances. In GMO, the equivalent might simply be owl:Thing as well, unless a more specific domain is defined for description-related properties.

Range (rdfs:range): The union of rdf:HTML and xsd:string suggests that the description can be either plain text or HTML content. In GMO, check for properties that allow multiple formats for text data. This might involve looking at datatype properties that are linked to string types or any special data type that allows rich text.

Label (rdfs:label): This literal is straightforward. In GMO, similar properties likely have clear labels, perhaps with the word ""Description"" in them.

Property Value pattern: Since the hasDescription property in GBO deals with datatype properties and specifying ranges that include text formats, the Property Value pattern in GMO might be designed to handle and structure these kinds of properties.

Personal Info Item pattern: If the hasDescription property can also apply to describing attributes or details about persons, this pattern might be relevant, especially if it manages how personal data is described or annotated in the ontology.

Person: Similarly, if descriptions pertain to individuals, the Person module could involve properties that describe personal characteristics, biographical data, or other descriptive info.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/).
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O.
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5.

The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time
and also ends at exactly one time
. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed. ObjectProperty: hasPersonalInfoItem ObjectProperty: hasCredential ObjectProperty: hasBirthEvent ObjectProperty: occursAtPlace ObjectProperty: occursAtTime ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: Person Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole","Based on the detailed descriptions you provided about the GMO ontology patterns and how they are structured, here's a revised mapping for the gbo:hasDescription(x, z) ↔ gmo:? equivalence:

GBO to GMO Mapping
GBO hasDescription: Describes an entity with a string or HTML content.

GMO Equivalent: The closest match within GMO for this property seems to be in the Information Object pattern. According to your description:

Information Object serves to model additional information assigned to an object, which can include descriptions, webpage links, and other textual annotations. This pattern aligns well with the intent of hasDescription in GBO, as it handles descriptive content about entities, which may be presented in different textual formats such as strings or URIs.
Detailed Look at Information Object Pattern
Properties like hasDescription, hasWebpage, seeAlso, hasCanonicalName, and alsoKnownAs within the Information Object pattern provide various ways to describe and link information about an object. These properties encapsulate functionalities similar to the GBO's hasDescription, allowing for a broad range of descriptive content.
Digital Object as a Subclass: The Information Object pattern may include or align with the Digital Object pattern in the future, suggesting its role in managing digital representations (like HTML content) which complements the GBO's allowance for rdf:HTML in the description range.
The Information Object pattern thus seems the most appropriate module within GMO to map to GBO's hasDescription due to its focus on describing entities with various types of information, including simple textual descriptions and more complex digital content representations. If this pattern has properties specifically named similar to hasDescription, that would directly correspond to the GBO property. If not, the general approach of the pattern to handle descriptive information would still serve as a functional equivalent.",FALSE,2/3,0.6666666667,2/5,0.4,,,1/4,0.75,,Recall_mean,0.6745283019,Precision_mean,0.6739255765

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

 The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. 
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. 
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. 

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. 


The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospa- tial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2.


A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.


This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property. 


The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5. ","Based on the descriptions provided for the patterns in GMO, to complete the mapping rule ""GBO: hasTitle(x, z) ↔ GMO:"", we need to identify the equivalent or related concept in GMO that matches the usage of the hasTitle property in GBO, which is used to assign titles to various types of entities.

Given the detailed description of the patterns in GMO, here are potential matches:

1. Information Object Pattern
This pattern appears most directly aligned with the hasTitle concept, as it is used to describe any object with additional information, which typically includes identifiers, descriptions, names, or titles. Here's the rule considering the usage of properties in this pattern:

GBO: hasTitle(x, z) ↔ GMO: hasCanonicalName(x, z)

Here, hasCanonicalName might serve as a suitable counterpart in GMO, assuming it is used in a similar manner to assign canonical names or titles to entities across various classes.
2. Identifier Pattern
Although not explicitly mentioned in your description above, if there's a specific pattern or property in GMO that directly maps identifiers or names to objects (like hasPrimaryIdentifier or a similar property), this could also be considered as part of the mapping rule:

GBO: hasTitle(x, z) ↔ GMO: hasPrimaryIdentifier(x, z)

This assumes that the title in GBO serves a similar purpose to primary identifiers in some contexts in GMO, which may not always be directly about titles but can serve a similar purpose of uniquely naming or describing entities.
3. Specific Entity Patterns
If individual patterns such as Physical Sample pattern, Funding Award pattern, or Vessel pattern use a specific property for naming or describing entities (e.g., hasDescription, hasName), these could also be included in the mapping:

GBO: hasTitle(x, z) ↔ GMO: hasDescription(x, z) / hasName(x, z)

These mappings would depend on the actual usage of such properties in the context of GMO and their alignment with the concept of titles or naming as used in GBO.
General Recommendation
To finalize and verify this mapping rule, I'd recommend reviewing the actual implementation details of the properties and classes in the GMO ontology, especially looking at how properties like hasCanonicalName, hasPrimaryIdentifier, or other naming/describing properties are utilized across different patterns and their specific domains. This review will ensure that the mapping is both accurate and meaningful in the context of how both ontologies are used and understood.",FALSE,1/3,0.3333333333,1/3,0.3333333333,,,2/5,0.6,,Recall_median,0.75,Precision_median,0.8

The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O.
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it.

 The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. 
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. 
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. 
 
The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2. 

A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern.

Mapping GBO to GMO
Based on the information, the most relevant GMO modules and patterns to the GBO property hasAbstract and the related classes (Award, Cruise, Dataset, Document, Program) are:

Information Object Pattern

Contains the hasDescription property, which is directly relevant to hasAbstract.
Applicable to any class that can have additional information.
Funding Award Pattern

Uses InformationObject for descriptions of funding awards.
Relevant to Award.
Cruise Micro-Ontology

Uses InformationObject for descriptions of cruises.
Relevant to Cruise.
Program Pattern

Uses InformationObject for descriptions of programs.
Relevant to Program.
Event Pattern

Uses InformationObject for descriptions of events.
Potentially relevant to Event, which could align with Award, Program, and Document.
Conclusion
The Information Object pattern is the most relevant module to align with the hasAbstract property due to its focus on providing descriptions and additional information for various classes. Other relevant modules include Funding Award, Cruise, Program, and Event patterns, which all utilize the Information Object pattern for descriptive properties.

I'll start by analyzing the gmo.ttl file to identify any classes, properties, or instances that match or relate to the ones from GBO you've mentioned. Let's begin with reading the file and looking for relevant pieces.

The gmo.ttl file starts with a series of namespace prefixes that are common in RDF and OWL ontologies, indicating that it is structured in a similar way to your GBO ontology snippet. It includes prefixes for RDF, RDFS, OWL, and others, alongside a specific prefix for what appears to be the GMO ontology itself (http://gmo).

To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the Identifier class and its associated properties (hasIdentifier, hasIdentifierScheme, hasIdentifierValue) from GBO, I will now search for these terms or related concepts within the content of the gmo.ttl file. This involves looking for classes, properties, comments, labels, or seeAlso references that match or are similar to the GBO ontology components you've described. ​​

In the gmo.ttl ontology, there are several parts related to identifiers and their schemes and values, similar to what you described in the GBO ontology. Here are the findings:

hasAlternativeIdentifier: An object property that might be used to capture alternative identifiers for entities.
hasPrimaryIdentifier: Another object property, possibly used to denote the primary identifier for entities.
hasIdentifierScheme: A datatype property that specifies the scheme of an identifier, similar to the hasIdentifierScheme in GBO.
hasIdentifierValue: While the snippet does not show the details, it's likely a property that captures the value of an identifier, akin to the hasIdentifierValue in GBO.
These elements indicate that while the GMO ontology uses slightly different terminology or categorizations for identifiers (e.g., distinguishing between primary and alternative identifiers), it shares the concept of identifying entities through schemes and values, as seen in GBO.

This analysis suggests a thematic overlap between the two ontologies concerning how identifiers are represented and managed, although the exact structure and naming conventions may vary. ​","""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing.

We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance.

Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5. 

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

Here are the relevant module names that can help in finding the related pieces:

Identifier: This module is directly related to the concept of identifiers and would be the primary module of interest.

Information Object: This module may also contain properties and classes related to identifiers as identifiers are often associated with information objects.

The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts specified in the GBO ontology snippet you provided, I'll first need to examine the content of the gmo.ttl file you uploaded. Specifically, I'll look for any components (classes, properties, or instances) that might correspond or be conceptually linked to the hasIdentifierValue property in GBO. This includes looking for properties with similar purposes (dealing with identifiers or their values), domains (related to Identifier or equivalent entities), and ranges (possibly xsd:string or similar).

Let's start by examining the gmo.ttl file to identify any relevant components.
The gmo.ttl file starts with a series of prefix declarations, indicating it defines or references entities within the GMO ontology using namespaces such as dc, owl, rdf, xsd, rdfs, skos, terms, and a specific prefix for GMO (glpv). To find pieces in GMO related to the hasIdentifierValue property from GBO, I'll search the file for definitions or usage of datatype properties, their domains and ranges, particularly focusing on properties related to identifiers or strings, and comments or labels that might indicate a connection to the concept of identifier values.

Let's proceed to search the gmo.ttl contents for relevant matches. ​​
After searching through the gmo.ttl file, I did not find any properties directly matching the criteria related to hasIdentifierValue from the GBO ontology, based on the specified domains (related to Identifier), ranges (xsd:string), or concepts related to identifier values within the given constraints of our search.

This could mean there are no directly comparable properties within the gmo.ttl content, at least not with the specific search parameters used. It's possible that the relevant properties in GMO might be defined with slightly different terminology, or the ontology structure might not emphasize identifiers in the same way.

If you have specific aspects of the hasIdentifierValue property you're most interested in (like its role in linking identifiers to their string values, or its use within a particular context), I could refine the search or analyze the ontology differently.

The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5. 




The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2.

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. ObjectProperty: isFundedBy ObjectProperty: startsOnDate ObjectProperty: endsOnDate ObjectProperty: isDescribedBy ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: hasAwardAmount ObjectProperty: hasCurrencyCode DataProperty: hasCurrencyValue Class: FundingAward Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: SponsorRole Class: PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: InformationObject Class: AwardAmount Class: CurrencyCode

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospa- tial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1. 


The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. 


The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5. 


The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship. 
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub. 


The Person Name pattern is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing a person’s name. We are aware that names and their usages are very culturally dependent. Making a versatile pattern for person names which is applicable in a multitude of cultural, national, and legislative contexts is a formidable challenge in its own right, and we consider this out of scope for our current purposes. In this sense, our person name pattern is a stub pattern, i.e. it is not fully developed. The intended usage is that fullNameAsString points to the full official name of the person, transcribed to latin letters, while firstOrGivenName and familyOrSurname point to the corresponding two parts of the name as that person would usually give them. While this is not a satisfactory solution for many contexts, it will serve our purpose for now – and we understand that a more sophisticated solution, which is out of scope for us at this stage, would be preferable. 
DataProperty: fullNameAsString DataProperty: firstOrGivenName DataProperty: familyOrSurname 
Class: Person Class: PersonName 


This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospatial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1. 


The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2. 
 The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth. 
  The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. 
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. 
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. 
  The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. 


This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 


Platform Pattern Stub 
This is a pattern stub, depicted in Figure 14.1, for representing ocean science platforms, which include vessels, submersibles, aircrafts, etc. 
Nomenclature for Platform pattern mainly consists of types of platform. Platform types are currently taken from the list maintained by SeaVoX L06 platform categories1. Other platform types are of course possible in the future. Table 14.1 contains all SeaVoX L06 platform categories, each is given as a pair of key and term.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample.

The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 

The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. 

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. 


The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospa- tial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern.

Property Value Pattern: This pattern in GMO is used to model inherent properties of objects, which is very much akin to how PlaceType in GBO categorizes places by inherent characteristics (e.g., ocean, shoreline, island).

Place Pattern: While it currently focuses on places of interest with geospatial features and associated non-geospatial information, this pattern is intended to eventually include more detailed geometric descriptions, which could align well with differentiating various PlaceType categories based on their spatial characteristics.

Place Pattern in GMO:

This pattern models places of interest, which aligns with the Place domain in the GBO's hasPlaceType.

This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

Property Value Pattern: This pattern in GMO fits the part where GeoFeature might have inherent properties such as material type, age, or other geospatial characteristics.

Event Pattern: If the GeoFeature involves observations or events occurring at that location, the Event pattern in GMO could be relevant. This pattern would cover occurrences at the GeoFeature location, including possible interactions with agents (through the Agent Role pattern).

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. 


The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospa- tial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1.

Reasoning:

Place: The Place pattern in GMO appears to be designed to handle geographical entities or features, which aligns well with the description of GeoFeatureType in GBO that deals with spatial features from gazetteers and includes vocabulary terms as instances. The mention of the Place pattern being associated with geospatial features and intending to align with the GeoSPARQL standard suggests a strong alignment with the GeoFeatureType that deals with spatial characteristics.

Property Value pattern: This pattern could potentially be used to describe specific properties of the GeoFeatureType in GMO, such as the type of material or other inherent properties, especially if those properties need precise modeling like metric units or type-specific classifications. However, for the direct mapping based on the class type, Place is more apt.

Therefore, the most straightforward mapping from gbo:GeoFeatureType in GBO to GMO would be to the Place module in GMO, which can represent the geospatial aspects of features described by GeoFeatureType.

Object Property: The main:hasGeoFeatureType in GBO functions similarly to any object properties within GMO that connect two entities, especially in terms of categorization or typing. In GMO, look for properties that define types or categories of agents, events, or physical samples.

Domain and Range: In GBO, main:GeoFeature as a domain and main:GeoFeatureType as a range suggest a specific relationship between a geographic feature and its type. In GMO, similar domain-range relationships might be seen in properties linking Person to Person Name or Organization to a specific organizational type or role.

SubPropertyOf: The usage of main:hasFeatureType and main:hasPlaceType as superproperties in GBO indicates a hierarchical relationship of properties. In GMO, you may have similar hierarchies within properties related to Person, Organization, or Physical Sample pattern, where more specific properties inherit characteristics from more general ones.

Inverse Property: The inverse property owl:inverseOf main:isGeoFeatureTypeOf suggests that if A has a geo-feature type of B, then B is a geo-feature type of A. This reciprocal relationship might be mirrored in GMO by properties that relate two entities bidirectionally, such as relationships between Person and Organization (e.g., employment or membership).

Possible Mappings in GMO:
Place Pattern:

Spatial Footprint: Given that isGeoFeatureTypeOf links a subject to a geographic entity, the most direct translation in GMO could involve connecting an entity (like an event or an organization) to a Place through its spatial properties. If there is a property that describes the spatial relationship or spatial footprint in the Place pattern, this could be a match. For example, gmo:hasSpatialFootprint(x, y) if y denotes a geometric feature such as a point, line, or polygon.
Event Pattern:

Location of Event: Since the Event pattern specifies that events occur at a Place, you could relate a geographic feature directly to where an event takes place. This could be modeled as gmo:takesPlaceAt(x, y), assuming y can be interpreted as a geographic feature or location related to the event.
Organization Pattern:

Organization Location: If there is a property that links organizations to their geographic locations within the Organization pattern, this could also be an interpretation. For example, you might use gmo:isLocatedAt(x, y) if y represents a geographical aspect of the organization's location.

The exact mapping would depend on the properties available within these patterns and their alignment with geographic features or locations. The rule could look like:

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. ObjectProperty: isFundedBy ObjectProperty: startsOnDate ObjectProperty: endsOnDate ObjectProperty: isDescribedBy ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: hasAwardAmount ObjectProperty: hasCurrencyCode DataProperty: hasCurrencyValue Class: FundingAward Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: SponsorRole Class: PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: InformationObject Class: AwardAmount Class: CurrencyCode



This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

In GBO, hasAward is an object property that links a Cruise to an Award.
In GMO, if there's a similar property, it would link entities like a Cruise, Event, or Program to an Award or Funding Award.
Inverse Property:

GBO uses isAwardOf as the inverse of hasAward.

Domain:

In GBO, the domain of hasAward is Cruise.
In GMO, the domain might be Cruise as well if it's similarly modeled, or potentially another kind of Event or related entity.
Range:

The range in GBO is Award.
In GMO, this could correspond to Funding Award or any similar class that represents awards or grants.
Label:

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2.

Agent Role - If ""isAwardOf"" implies a role an agent (such as a person or organization) plays in relation to an award, the Agent Role module might define various roles related to the administration, receipt, or oversight of funding.

Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. ObjectProperty: isFundedBy ObjectProperty: startsOnDate ObjectProperty: endsOnDate ObjectProperty: isDescribedBy ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: hasAwardAmount ObjectProperty: hasCurrencyCode DataProperty: hasCurrencyValue Class: FundingAward Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: SponsorRole Class: PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: InformationObject Class: AwardAmount Class: CurrencyCode

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

This mapping leverages the isFundedBy property from the GMO's Funding Award pattern, which connects entities (like projects, research activities, or organizations) to their funding awards.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

Explanation:
gbo:Award(z) from GBO corresponds to gmo:FundingAward(z) in GMO, describing an entity (z) that is a funding award.
gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) in GBO relates to a combined use of gmo:providesAgentRole(z, x) and gmo:CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole(x) in GMO, where:
gmo:providesAgentRole(z, x) links the award (z) to an agent role (x) it provides.
gmo:CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole(x) specifies that the role (x) is specifically that of a co-principal investigator.

In GBO, an Award is described as funding provided by an organization enabling participation. It is analogous to the Funding Award in GMO, which likely serves a similar purpose of representing grants or financial support provided by an organization.
hasPrincipalInvestigator (GBO) vs properties in GMO:

The property hasPrincipalInvestigator in GBO relates a person to an Award or a Program as their principal investigator. In GMO, this would likely correspond to a property or relationship that connects a person (as a principal investigator or similar role) to a Funding Award or a Program.

It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole.

hasProgramManager:

This property in GBO is used to link an Award or Program to a Person who manages it. The inverse property is isProgramManagerOf.
In GMO, if there's a property related to managing or overseeing programs or awards, it would be equivalent. Look for properties under Funding Award or Program classes that denote managerial roles or responsibilities. You might also consider broader properties under Person that signify management or leadership roles if a direct equivalent isn't available.
Program: In the GBO, this is likely linked with the Award through the hasProgramManager property. In GMO, if there's a Program class or something similar that denotes structured plans or initiatives often tied to funding or organizational goals, that would be your counterpart.

We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern.
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern.

Award (GBO) and Related Concepts in GMO:

The Award in GBO is defined as funding provided by an organization enabling participation.
In the GMO ontology, there is a concept of Funding Award that might align with this. This concept would likely encapsulate the details of funding provided for different activities or programs, much like the Award in GBO.
hasStartDate (GBO) and Related Concepts in GMO:

The hasStartDate property in GBO is a datatype property applied to several classes such as Award, Dataset, Meeting, and Program.
In the GMO ontology, if there are properties that specify the start dates of events, projects, or funding periods, these would be analogous. You would typically find such properties linked to concepts like Event, Program, or any temporal aspect of projects and activities.

hasStartDate (GBO):

Event (GMO): Since the hasStartDate property is used for events like meetings, programs, and datasets, the Event module is relevant as it deals with temporal aspects such as start and end times.
Program (GMO): This module could be related since hasStartDate is relevant to the temporal aspects of programs.
Physical Sample pattern (GMO): This module might include datasets and their temporal attributes, making it relevant to the hasStartDate property in GBO.

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern.
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc.

This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 


A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned.

Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 



This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

Agent Role: This is potentially relevant because it might define roles such as ""Principal Investigator"" or ""Co-Principal Investigator"".
Event: This could be relevant if Program or related activities are defined as events.
Information Object: This is likely less relevant unless Program is defined as an informational object.
Identifier: Likely not directly relevant, but could be if identifiers are crucial in defining relationships.
Person: Highly relevant as hasCoPrincipalInvestigator involves persons.
Personal Info Item pattern: This could relate if personal details of investigators are crucial.
Person Name: Less relevant unless specific handling of names is defined separately.
Organization: Potentially relevant if programs are associated with organizations.
Funding Award: Highly relevant as Program often involves funding.
Program: Directly relevant.
Place: Relevant if geographical location is a factor in defining Program.
Cruise: Less relevant unless Program involves marine activities.
Platform Pattern Stub: Less relevant unless specific platform definitions are needed.
Vessel pattern: Less relevant unless related to marine activities.
Physical Sample pattern: Less relevant unless physical samples are part of Program.
Property Value pattern: Less relevant unless properties and values play a role in defining relationships.
Most Relevant Modules:
Person: hasCoPrincipalInvestigator involves persons, making this module crucial.
Agent Role: This could define roles such as ""Principal Investigator"" or ""Co-Principal Investigator"".
Funding Award: Since Program often involves funding, this module is important.
Program: Directly relevant for defining Program.
Organization: Programs might be associated with organizations.
Agent: Encompasses entities that act in various roles, which could include investigators.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.
                                  

 The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. 
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. 
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. 
 


This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.




The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. ObjectProperty: isFundedBy ObjectProperty: startsOnDate ObjectProperty: endsOnDate ObjectProperty: isDescribedBy ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: hasAwardAmount ObjectProperty: hasCurrencyCode DataProperty: hasCurrencyValue Class: FundingAward Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: SponsorRole Class: PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: InformationObject Class: AwardAmount Class: CurrencyCode

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 
 ObjectProperty: isAgentRoleIn ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: startsAtTime ObjectProperty: endsAtTime

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 



This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

Based on the information provided, the relevant objects in the GMO ontology include:

Classes:

Program: Represents a program in the geoscience research community.
Agent: Represents an entity (person or organization) involved in the program.
AgentRole: Represents the role performed by an agent within the program context.
PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole: Specific types of AgentRole.
Object Properties:

isAgentRoleIn: Connects an AgentRole to its context (e.g., program).
providesAgentRole: Connects an entity (e.g., organization, cruise) to the agent roles it provides.
isPerformedBy: Connects an AgentRole to the Agent that performs it.
startsAtTime: Indicates the start time of an AgentRole.
endsAtTime: Indicates the end time of an AgentRole.

The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5.

To find the objects in the GMO ontology that can complete the complex rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasAcronym(x, z) → gmo:?, we need to identify the relevant classes and properties in the GMO ontology that correspond to Program and hasAcronym.

In GMO, the Program class represents formally recognized scientific efforts. This aligns directly with the Program class in GBO.
Properties associated with Program:

isAssociatedWithProgram: This property can connect any entity (e.g., funding awards, digital object records) to a Program.
hasCanonicalName: This property provides the canonical name of an instance as a string, which can be similar to an acronym.
alsoKnownAs: This property provides an alternative name aside from the canonical name, which can also be considered as an acronym.
hasDescription: This property provides a description of the instance.
hasWebpage: This property provides a URL for more information.
Class: InformationObject:

This class models additional information assigned to an object, such as descriptions and webpages, which could include acronyms.

Steps to Identify Related Parts
Search for the ""Program"" Class:

Look for a class in the GMO ontology that has a label or comment mentioning ""Program"" or a similar concept.
Check if there are any classes that describe a formally recognized scientific effort.
Search for the ""hasEndDate"" Property:

Look for a datatype property in the GMO ontology with a label or comment mentioning ""end date"" or a similar concept.
Check if this property has a domain that includes entities like awards, datasets, meetings, or programs and a range of xsd:dateTime.
Manually Checking the Ontology
You can open the GMO ontology file (gmo.ttl) in a text editor or an RDF editor like Protégé and search for relevant terms.

For the ""Program"" class:

Search for the term ""Program"" in the ontology to find any class definitions or comments.
For the ""hasEndDate"" property:

Search for the term ""end date"" or similar terms to find any datatype property definitions or comments.

2. hasEndDate
Relevant Modules: Funding Award, Program, Meeting, Dataset
The ""hasEndDate"" property in the GBO ontology applies to several domains, including awards, datasets, meetings, and programs. Therefore, the most relevant modules in the GMO ontology are:
Funding Award: This module might define properties related to awards, which could include an end date.
Program: This module might define properties related to programs, which could include an end date.
Event: Since meetings are types of events, this module might define properties related to events, which could include an end date.
Information Object: This module might include datasets and other informational entities that could have end dates.
In summary, the most relevant module in the GMO ontology for finding pieces related to the GBO ""Program"" class is the Program module. For the ""hasEndDate"" property, the relevant modules are Funding Award, Program, Event, and Information Object.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","
ChatGPT
To identify pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts you've described in the GBO ontology, I'll need to examine the gmo.ttl file you've uploaded. I'll look for concepts and properties in the GMO ontology that might correspond to or have relationships with the Program class and the hasStartDate property from the GBO ontology.

I'll start by reading the contents of the gmo.ttl file to understand its structure and to find any related parts. Let's proceed with that.
The contents of the GMO ontology file begin with namespace declarations, which are standard in RDF and OWL ontologies to define prefixes for frequently used URIs. This makes the file easier to read and write by avoiding the repetition of long URIs.

Given the brief look at the beginning of the file, it's clear that the ontology defines a variety of concepts, likely including classes and properties relevant to genetically modified organisms. To find components related to the Program class and the hasStartDate property as you described in the GBO ontology, I will search the content for:

Classes that might correspond to or be equivalent to Program.
Properties similar to hasStartDate, which could be used to indicate the start date of a program or related entities.
Let me analyze the entire file content to identify these related parts. ​​
In the GMO ontology, there is a mention of ""Program,"" suggesting there's a component related to the Program class you described in the GBO ontology. However, there doesn't appear to be a direct mention of hasStartDate or a property that directly corresponds to it based on the initial search.

Since ""Program"" is present, this might imply the existence of a class or concept within the GMO ontology that aligns with the notion of a program as defined in GBO. The absence of a direct mention of ""hasStartDate"" suggests that the GMO ontology may use a different property to denote the start dates of programs or related entities, or it might not explicitly model this information.

To provide more detailed information, I can look further into the ontology to extract the exact definitions or descriptions related to ""Program"". Would you like me to proceed with this, or is there another way you'd like to explore the contents of the GMO ontology?","""""""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

InformationObject ⊑ (=1 isDescribedBy−.Program)

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern. In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions. Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc. ObjectProperty: isFundedBy ObjectProperty: startsOnDate ObjectProperty: endsOnDate ObjectProperty: isDescribedBy ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: hasAwardAmount ObjectProperty: hasCurrencyCode DataProperty: hasCurrencyValue Class: FundingAward Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: SponsorRole Class: PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: InformationObject Class: AwardAmount Class: CurrencyCode

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property).
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization.
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern.
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through
the hasSubOrganization property.  
Datatype: xsd:string

Class: Organization Class: Person
Class: InformationObject Class: Country

Class: AgentAffiliationRole
Class: OrganizationAffiliationRole Class: PersonAffiliationRole


The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 
 ObjectProperty: isAgentRoleIn ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: startsAtTime ObjectProperty: endsAtTime 
Class: AgentRole Class: Agent Class: TimeInstant 
 
The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 


The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospatial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1.

An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 

The Identifier pattern, as depicted in Figure 5.1, captures arbitrary identifiers that a data provider may use on their data. This is especially useful for non-URI identifiers such as local catalogue numbers, etc. We expect identifier information to be used in conjunction with the Information Object pattern (Chapter 5, although we do not axiomatize it here. We model an identifier to have exactly one string literal as its value, and at most one identifier scheme. The scheme can either be a string literal or a URI.

For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization.
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern.
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment).

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 
 ObjectProperty: isAgentRoleIn ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: startsAtTime ObjectProperty: endsAtTime

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 



The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed. ObjectProperty: hasPersonalInfoItem ObjectProperty: hasCredential ObjectProperty: hasBirthEvent ObjectProperty: occursAtPlace ObjectProperty: occursAtTime ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: Person Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole
The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

Class: Person
Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place
Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole


The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship. 
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub. 

  
This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property).
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization.
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern.
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through
the hasSubOrganization property.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 



The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed. ObjectProperty: hasPersonalInfoItem ObjectProperty: hasCredential ObjectProperty: hasBirthEvent ObjectProperty: occursAtPlace ObjectProperty: occursAtTime ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: Person Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole
The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 
ObjectProperty: hasPersonalInfoItem ObjectProperty: hasCredential ObjectProperty: hasBirthEvent ObjectProperty: occursAtPlace ObjectProperty: occursAtTime ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole
Class: Person
Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place
Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole


This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

","""more information about GMO:
The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the specified parts in the GBO ontology, I'll need to analyze the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. I'll look for classes, properties, and relationships that correspond or are semantically related to the Person class and the hasGivenName property described in your GBO ontology.

I'll start by examining the contents of the GMO ontology file. Let's see what we can find that relates to Person and personal names.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue accessing the details of the GMO ontology file. Let's try a different approach to open and analyze the file's contents correctly. I'll attempt to parse the ontology file directly and look for elements that correspond to those in the GBO ontology related to the Person class and hasGivenName property. Let's proceed with this analysis. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like we're encountering an issue analyzing the GMO ontology file directly in this environment. This might be due to limitations in handling ontology files directly or specific content in the file that's not being processed as expected.

Given these constraints, I can provide guidance on how you might approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology components you mentioned. Here's a general strategy you can apply using ontology editing tools or programming libraries designed for semantic web technologies (such as RDFlib in Python):

Load both Ontologies: Use an ontology editor (like Protégé) or a library (like RDFlib for Python) to load both your GMO and GBO ontologies.
Identify Key Concepts and Properties in GBO: You've already identified Person and hasGivenName as key parts of GBO.
Search for Equivalent or Similar Concepts in GMO:
For the Person class, look for classes in GMO that represent individuals, humans, or agents. Equivalence might be direct (e.g., a Human or Agent class) or require interpretation (e.g., a Member class that implies personhood).
For the hasGivenName property, search for properties related to names in GMO. This might include properties explicitly about names (givenName, firstName) or more generally about identifying information (identifier, label).
Use Semantic Relationships to Find Connections: If direct matches aren't found, explore semantic relationships. For example, properties or classes in GMO related to personal identification, familial relationships, or descriptive attributes might indirectly relate to Person and hasGivenName.
Leverage Ontology Reasoning Tools: Some tools can infer relationships or suggest equivalences between different ontology elements based on their definitions and the ontology's overall structure.
Consult Documentation or Domain Experts: If GMO has accompanying documentation or if there are domain experts available, their insights could be invaluable in identifying related concepts.
This approach requires a bit of manual investigation and interpretation, especially when direct equivalents aren't obvious. If you're able to use specific tools or libraries and encounter technical challenges, I'd be happy to provide more direct assistance with those. ​","This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

The Person Name pattern is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing a person’s name. We are aware that names and their usages are very culturally dependent. Making a versatile pattern for person names which is applicable in a multitude of cultural, national, and legislative contexts is a formidable challenge in its own right, and we consider this out of scope for our current purposes. In this sense, our person name pattern is a stub pattern, i.e. it is not fully developed. The intended usage is that fullNameAsString points to the full official name of the person, transcribed to latin letters, while firstOrGivenName and familyOrSurname point to the corresponding two parts of the name as that person would usually give them. While this is not a satisfactory solution for many contexts, it will serve our purpose for now – and we understand that a more sophisticated solution, which is out of scope for us at this stage, would be preferable.

Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering an unexpected issue accessing the file you uploaded. This prevents me from directly inspecting or processing the GMO ontology.

Despite this, we can still discuss the general approach to finding related pieces in one ontology based on another. Identifying related components between two ontologies, like GMO and GBO in your case, typically involves comparing their classes, properties, and instances, focusing on similarities in their names, labels, comments, or the structure of the ontology itself.

For your specific request, we would look for classes and properties in the GMO ontology that match or relate to the Person class and the hasFamilyName property in the GBO ontology. This could include direct equivalents or more broadly related concepts, depending on the specific structure and content of the GMO ontology.

If you're able to resolve the file access issue on your side or provide more details about the GMO ontology, I could give you more targeted advice. Alternatively, if you have specific questions about ontology alignment or comparison techniques, I'm here to help with that too","This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Give a most relevant module that can help us in finding the relevant pieces""","To determine the most relevant module in the GMO ontology that aligns with the provided GBO pieces, we need to focus on modules that deal with the Person class and related properties, especially those handling personal information such as names.

Given the provided list of modules and patterns in the GMO ontology, the most relevant modules related to the GBO pieces (Person class and properties like hasFamilyName) are:

Person
Person Name
Personal Info Item pattern
Most Relevant Module
The Person Name module is likely the most relevant because it explicitly deals with the various components of a person's name, which directly aligns with the hasFamilyName and related properties in the GBO ontology.

Relevant Modules Summary
Person

Deals with the definition and characteristics of a person.
Person Name

Deals with properties related to different parts of a person's name, such as hasFamilyName, hasGivenName, etc.
Personal Info Item pattern

Deals with personal information items, which might include name components.
By exploring the Person Name module, you will likely find the most relevant properties and definitions that correspond to the Person class and the hasFamilyName property in the GBO ontology.","more information about GMO:
The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual personal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

The Person Name pattern is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing a person’s name. We are aware that names and their usages are very culturally dependent. Making a versatile pattern for person names which is applicable in a multitude of cultural, national, and legislative contexts is a formidable challenge in its own right, and we consider this out of scope for our current purposes. In this sense, our person name pattern is a stub pattern, i.e. it is not fully developed. The intended usage is that fullNameAsString points to the full official name of the person, transcribed to latin letters, while firstOrGivenName and familyOrSurname point to the corresponding two parts of the name as that person would usually give them. While this is not a satisfactory solution for many contexts, it will serve our purpose for now – and we understand that a more sophisticated solution, which is out of scope for us at this stage, would be preferable.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

Given the detailed information about the GMO ontology and its patterns, the following GMO elements are relevant:

Class: Person (from the Person pattern)
Class: PersonName (from the Person Name pattern)
Property: familyOrSurname (from the Person Name pattern)
Property: hasPersonName (alignment with the Person Name pattern)
Detailed Mapping:
GBO's Person class maps to GMO's Person class.
GBO's hasFamilyName property maps to GMO's familyOrSurname property.
Complex Rule Mapping:
The complex rule Person(x) ∧ hasFamilyName(x, z) → ? in GBO can be mapped to GMO as follows:

Person(x) maps to the Person class in GMO.
hasFamilyName(x, z) maps to the familyOrSurname property in GMO, where x is an instance of Person and z is the family name.
In GMO, this relationship can be represented using the hasPersonName property to link a Person to their PersonName, and then use the familyOrSurname property to specify the family name.

  The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14.

We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1.

 The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

It looks like I've encountered an unexpected issue with processing the GMO ontology file, preventing me from directly extracting and comparing the information as intended.

Concept Matching: Identify similar or equivalent classes and properties by comparing their labels, comments, and definitions if available. This involves looking for terms like ""Platform"" and ""PlatformType"" in the GMO ontology and seeing if they have analogous classes or roles.
Property Analysis: Compare the properties in both ontologies by looking at their domains, ranges, and any specified inverse properties. For instance, if GBO has hasPlatformType with a certain domain and range, search for properties in GMO with similar domain-range configurations.
Ontology Structure: Examine the overall structure of the GMO ontology to see how it organizes its concepts and relationships. This might give you clues about where to find related concepts, especially if the ontology uses a hierarchical structure that groups related concepts together.
Semantic Similarity: Tools and methods that measure semantic similarity or relatedness between ontology entities can be useful. These might include machine learning models trained on ontological data or algorithms designed to assess similarity based on the structure of the ontology graph.
Without direct access to the ontology content, these approaches are theoretical but can guide you in manually reviewing or using automated tools to compare the GBO and GMO ontologies.

  The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.

 The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/).
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2.

Platform Pattern Stub 
This is a pattern stub, depicted in Figure 14.1, for representing ocean science platforms, which include vessels, submersibles, aircrafts, etc. 
Nomenclature for Platform pattern mainly consists of types of platform. Platform types are currently taken from the list maintained by SeaVoX L06 platform categories1. Other platform types are of course possible in the future. Table 14.1 contains all SeaVoX L06 platform categories, each is given as a pair of key and term. 
* Platform ⊑ (=1 isDescribedBy.InformationObject) ∃isDescribedBy.InformationObject ⊑ Platform  Platform ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject 


This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

 pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

gmo: The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1.
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern.
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.
Nomenclature part of the Vessel pattern includes terms describing properties relevant for a vessel (Fig- ure 15.2) and types of agent-roles provided by a vessel (Figure 15.3). In this part, properties of every vessel includes a length, beam, draft, and displacement. In addition, a vessel provides an owner role. Note that the owner role here is specific for vessels, and this is realized by defining it under Vessel pattern’s URI namespace.
Every vessel has exactly one information object. Also, we assert the guarded domain and range restrictions.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. 



The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2. 



The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample.

gmo:Vessel(z): Maps the vessel entity in GBO to the vessel class in GMO.
gmo:providesAgentRole(z, gmo:OwnerRole): Indicates that the vessel provides the role of an owner.
gmo:isPerformedBy(gmo:OwnerRole, x): Specifies that the owner role is performed by an agent x, completing the ownership relationship.

Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”,

Given this below information about GMO, :
The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. 


This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.

Term Matching: Look for exact matches or similar labels between entities in both ontologies. For instance, if GBO has a class ""Cruise,"" you could search for a class with a similar name in GMO.

Property Matching: If GBO has specific properties, like ""hasCoChiefScientist,"" you could look for properties in GMO that serve a similar role, perhaps something related to personnel or roles within an event or activity.

Hierarchy Inspection: Examine the class hierarchies in GMO to find classes that might be equivalent or closely related to those in GBO. For example, if ""Cruise"" is a subclass of an ""Event"" in GBO, there might be a similar structure in GMO.

Domain and Range Comparison: Properties like ""hasCoChiefScientist"" have specific domains and ranges (in this case, ""Cruise"" and ""Person""). Finding properties in GMO with similar domain and range relationships could indicate relatedness.

Semantic Similarity: Beyond direct string matching, semantic similarity tools or ontology alignment tools can help identify related concepts based on the meanings and contexts of terms.

If you're looking for a specific type of relationship or more detailed assistance on how to programmatically achieve these comparisons, please let me know!","""""""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Give a most relevant module that can help us in finding the relevant pieces""","Based on the provided modules and patterns in the GMO ontology, let's identify the most relevant ones that align with the GBO pieces related to the 'Cruise' class and the 'hasCoChiefScientist' object property.

GBO Ontology Pieces
Cruise (Class)

Defined as an event occurring on a vessel.
hasCoChiefScientist (Object Property)

Connects a Cruise to a Person in the role of a Co-Chief Scientist.
Relevant GMO Modules
Event:

Likely includes classes and properties related to events, which would cover the concept of a 'Cruise'.
Cruise:

Directly related to the GBO 'Cruise' class and would contain specific details about cruises.
Agent Role:

This module likely includes roles and responsibilities of agents (e.g., scientists), which would cover the role of a Co-Chief Scientist.
Person:

This module covers individual persons, which would be necessary for defining the range of the 'hasCoChiefScientist' property.
Vessel pattern:

Since a cruise occurs on a vessel, this module would be relevant for contextual information related to vessels involved in cruises.
Most Relevant Module
The Cruise module in the GMO ontology is the most relevant for finding the pieces related to the GBO 'Cruise' class and the 'hasCoChiefScientist' property. This module would encompass specific details about cruises, including associated events and roles such as Chief Scientist.

Next Steps
To align the GBO 'Cruise' class and 'hasCoChiefScientist' property with the GMO ontology:

Cruise (Class in GMO):

Look into the 'Cruise' module to find the corresponding class definition and properties.
hasCoChiefScientist (Object Property in GMO):

Explore the 'Cruise' and 'Agent Role' modules to find properties that link a cruise to a person with the role of a Chief Scientist.
Would you like to delve deeper into the specifics of these modules, or do you have any other questions related to the ontology alignment?","""Given this below information about GMO:


The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014]. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the specification of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pattern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise as an event is elaborated in more detail in Section 13.1.2.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depicted in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Person pattern, The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.

It seems there was an issue accessing the contents of the GMO ontology file. Let's try a different approach to read and analyze the file's content so I can help you find the pieces related to the GBO ontology's Cruise event and the ""isScientistOf"" relationship. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like I'm facing a persistent issue accessing the content of the GMO ontology file directly. However, I can still provide guidance on how you might approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the information from the GBO ontology you've shared.

Given the nature of the concepts ""Cruise"" and the relationship ""isScientistOf"" from the GBO ontology:

Cruise: Look for classes in GMO that represent events or activities occurring over a period, especially those involving transportation or scientific exploration. Classes related to vessels, watercraft, or any form of maritime travel would be particularly relevant. Additionally, look for classes or properties that might represent or connect to the concept of a trajectory, which could indicate movement or travel paths.

isScientistOf: This object property suggests a relationship between individuals (presumably scientists) and an entity (which could be events, projects, or organizations). In the GMO ontology, search for object properties that denote roles, affiliations, or participation of individuals in activities or organizations. Properties that link people to their work, research, or contributions would be of interest.

To find these relations:

Use ontology exploration tools or software that can handle the Turtle (TTL) format, such as Protégé.
Search for terms like ""event"", ""activity"", ""vessel"", ""trajectory"", ""scientist"", ""research"", and their synonyms.
Examine the RDF types (classes), RDF properties (especially object properties), and any specific instances that match or are conceptually similar to the concepts you're interested in from GBO.
This approach should help you identify related concepts in the GMO ontology despite the direct access issue.

Event: This module is likely to encompass the Cruise class since a cruise is an event that occurs over a period of time and involves specific activities.

Agent Role: This module can be relevant for defining roles such as scientists in the context of events like a cruise. It can help in defining the relationship captured by the isScientistOf object property.

Most Relevant Module:
The Event module is the most relevant module to start with, as it directly deals with events, and a cruise is described as an event in the GBO ontology. This module will help in finding the class definition and properties related to events such as a cruise.

Additional Relevant Module:
The Agent Role module is also significant because it will provide the necessary framework for defining roles like scientists and their relationships with events. This is crucial for mapping the isScientistOf object property.

By focusing on these modules, you should be able to find the relevant classes and properties in the GMO ontology that correspond to the Cruise class and isScientistOf object property in the GBO ontology.","Given this below information about GMO,
The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini-mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

This class captures the notion of a cruise as an event with spatiotemporal dimensions and agent roles.
Class: Person

GMO: gmo:Person

I'll look for classes, properties, or instances that are semantically or structurally related to these concepts, such as those involving vessels, trajectories, educational roles, or events.

Let's start by examining the content of the GMO ontology file you've provided. I'll analyze the file and then share my findings on the relations between GMO and the GBO components you mentioned.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue accessing the content of the GMO ontology file you uploaded. Let's try a different approach to load and analyze the content of the file, focusing on identifying elements related to the ""Cruise"" class and the ""isEducatorIn"" property from the GBO ontology. I'll attempt to read the file again and extract relevant information. ​​
Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering difficulties accessing and reading the content of the GMO ontology file directly. Given these limitations, I can provide a general approach on how to manually find pieces in GMO that are related to the ""Cruise"" class and the ""isEducatorIn"" property mentioned in your GBO ontology.

For the ""Cruise"" Class: Search the GMO ontology for classes that represent events, activities, or entities related to vessels, water travel, or trajectories. These could include classes directly representing vessels, trips, or navigational paths. Pay special attention to properties and comments that link these classes to the concept of a cruise or related activities.

For the ""isEducatorIn"" Property: Look for object properties in GMO that denote roles, activities, or relations involving teaching, education, or guidance within a particular context. This could involve properties linking individuals to educational events, roles within a learning activity, or associations between educators and other entities.

Semantic Relations: Examine the semantic relationships between classes and properties in GMO and those in GBO. This includes subclassing (rdfs:subClassOf), domain and range specifications (rdfs:domain, rdfs:range), and annotations that provide semantic context (rdfs:comment, rdfs:label).

Equivalent or Similar Concepts: Look for owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty relations that might explicitly link concepts in GMO to those in GBO, indicating direct equivalents or very closely related concepts.

This approach requires a manual or programmatic analysis of the GMO ontology. If you have specific tools or environments you're working within (e.g., Protégé, RDFLib in Python), they can facilitate searching and analyzing these relationships. If you can describe the environment or tools you're using, I might be able to provide more directed advice on how to proceed. ​","This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Relevant Modules for GBO Cruise Class:
The Cruise class in GBO is described as ""An event occurring on a Vessel traversing a Trajectory."" The modules in GMO that might be most relevant are:

Cruise: This is directly related and likely contains detailed definitions and relationships about cruises.
Vessel pattern: Since a cruise involves a vessel, this pattern might provide necessary vessel-related details.
Event: A cruise is an event, so this module could contain relevant event-related properties and classes.
Relevant Modules for GBO isEducatorIn Object Property:
The isEducatorIn object property in GBO relates to the involvement of an educator in a certain context. The modules in GMO that might be relevant are:

Agent: Educators can be considered a type of agent, and this module might define roles and relationships for agents.
Agent Role: This module might provide more specific roles, including educational roles, and their relationships.
Most Relevant Module:
To find the most relevant pieces for both the Cruise class and the isEducatorIn object property, the Cruise module appears to be the most relevant. This module likely contains detailed information about cruises, including their association with vessels and trajectories. For the isEducatorIn object property, while the direct match is less clear, the Agent Role module would be crucial as it might define various roles that an agent (including an educator) might hold.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.
The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","It looks like I encountered an issue while trying to process the GMO ontology file. Let's approach this from a theoretical standpoint, given the typical structures found in ontologies and the information you've provided about GBO.

In ontologies, relatedness can be determined through several avenues:

Semantic Similarity: Looking for classes or properties in GMO that have a similar meaning or use as Cruise and hasStudent in GBO. For example, any class or property related to events on vehicles or properties denoting participation could be relevant.

Class Hierarchy: If GMO contains a class hierarchy that includes classes for events, vehicles (like vessels), or people (like students), we could identify classes that are superclasses or subclasses of Cruise and entities related to Person.

Property Domain and Range: In GBO, hasStudent has a domain of Cruise and a range of Person. In GMO, we'd look for properties with similar domains and ranges—properties that connect events or activities to individuals.

Inverse Properties: Given that hasStudent is inverse of isStudentIn, we'd search for any inverse property pairs in GMO that connect similar concepts.

Without being able to directly query the GMO ontology due to the technical hiccup, here's a hypothetical strategy to find related pieces in GMO based on the GBO ontology you've provided:

Search for classes that represent any form of event or gathering, particularly those that involve transportation or are specific to certain types of vehicles.
Look for object properties that denote a relationship between an event and participants or roles within that event. This includes properties with domains and ranges involving event-like classes and people or roles akin to ""student"".
Explore the ontology for inverse properties that might reflect the inverse relationship observed in GBO between hasStudent and isStudentIn.
If you have specific details you're curious about within GMO or if there's another way you'd like me to assist with these ontologies, please let me know!","This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

GBO Pieces
Cruise Class: An event occurring on a Vessel traversing a Trajectory.
hasStudent Object Property: A property relating a Cruise to a Person with the inverse isStudentIn.
Relevant Modules in GMO Ontology
Here’s an analysis of the most relevant modules from the GMO ontology that might align with these GBO pieces:

Cruise Module: This is directly related to the Cruise class in GBO, focusing on events happening on vessels.
Event Module: The Cruise class in GBO is an event, so the Event module will contain relevant properties and class definitions.
Vessel Pattern Module: Since a Cruise involves a vessel, this module might contain relevant details about the vessel involved in a cruise.
Agent Module: In the context of hasStudent, this module might provide details about people involved in the cruise, such as students.
Agent Role Module: This module can be relevant if the hasStudent property involves specific roles or responsibilities assigned to individuals.
Most Relevant Module
Cruise Module: This module is likely the most directly relevant as it specifically deals with cruises and should contain detailed information about events, vessels, and potentially associated roles.

Would you like to delve deeper into the Cruise module, or do you need detailed information from other related modules as well?","Given this information about GMO,
The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.
The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3. 
 ObjectProperty: isAgentRoleIn ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: startsAtTime 
ObjectProperty: endsAtTime

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organization. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. 


This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforeced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern.

Although I can't directly execute the query as intended, I can suggest an approach for you to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology snippets you've provided:

For Classes like ""Cruise"": You should look for classes in the GMO ontology that are either subclasses or superclasses of a class similar to ""Cruise"" or have annotations (like comments or labels) that mention terms related to ""Cruise"", such as ""Vessel"", ""Trajectory"", or ""Event"".

For Object Properties like ""isStudentIn"": Search for object properties in the GMO ontology that might serve a similar role or are related in the hierarchy to ""isStudentIn"". This involves identifying triples with rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty and exploring their relations using predicates like rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentProperty, or even their domain and range specifications.

The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

Error analyzing
It looks like I've encountered a technical problem trying to process the GMO ontology file to find related pieces to your GBO ontology. This might be due to an issue with the file format, a mismatch in the expected ontology structure, or a limitation in my current environment.

Since direct querying didn't work as expected, we might need to take a different approach to solve your query. If you have specific aspects of the GMO ontology you're interested in comparing or if there are keywords or concepts you suspect might be related, we could discuss those directly or explore alternative ways to access the information in your GMO ontology.

Alternatively, if you're comfortable with RDF and SPARQL queries, I can guide you on how to manually write and execute a query that might reveal the relationships you're interested in, using a local RDF tool or a script.

Based on the GBO pieces you provided and the list of modules and patterns in the GMO ontology, the most relevant module that can help in finding the related pieces is the Cruise module. Here’s why:

Cruise Class:

The GBO Cruise class, defined as an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory, directly aligns with the concepts in the Cruise module in the GMO ontology. This module will provide detailed information about the Cruise class and related properties in GMO.
hasObserver Object Property:

The GBO hasObserver object property involves the Cruise and Dive classes with a range of Person. The Cruise module in GMO, along with possibly the Agent Role and Event modules, will help identify how observers or roles are modeled within a cruise context.
Most Relevant Module:
Cruise Module
Additional Supporting Modules:
Agent Role (to understand roles like observer)
Event (since cruises are events and might involve participants)
Person (to map the range of the hasObserver property)
These modules together will help us map the GBO Cruise class and hasObserver object property to their GMO equivalents.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that relate to the specified parts of the GBO ontology, I'll need to analyze the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. This will involve looking for classes, object properties, or other ontology elements that are semantically or directly related to the concepts of ""Cruise"" (as an event on a vessel traversing a trajectory) and ""isObserverIn"" (as an object property).

I will start by examining the GMO ontology file to identify any relevant classes, properties, or relationships. Let's begin.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue processing the GMO ontology to find related elements to those described in your GBO ontology. The error occurred while trying to parse or search through the ontology, which might be due to the specific content or structure of the GMO file.

To proceed, we can try a more focused approach to directly query for elements related to ""Cruise"" and ""isObserverIn"" within the GMO ontology. This will involve constructing specific queries that look for classes and properties that either match these names or have semantic connections to the concepts of cruising events and observer relationships.

Let's adjust our approach and try again. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered another issue trying to execute a SPARQL query on the GMO ontology to find related elements to the ""Cruise"" class and ""isObserverIn"" property from your GBO ontology. This problem could be due to several reasons, such as issues with the ontology file itself or the specifics of how the query was constructed and executed.

Given these challenges, I recommend a few alternative approaches:

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology is not too large, manual inspection could be feasible to identify related elements. This involves looking at the ontology in a text editor or an RDF viewer to search for relevant classes and properties.

Ontology Tools: Utilizing dedicated ontology management and visualization tools (e.g., Protégé, WebVOWL) could provide a more intuitive way to explore the GMO ontology and find elements related to your GBO ontology concepts.

Query Adjustment: Adjusting the SPARQL query to be more general or targeted, depending on the structure of the GMO ontology. This could involve simplifying the query or focusing on specific sections of the ontology.

Without being able to process the file directly due to the encountered issues, these alternative methods might help in identifying the relationships and elements you're interested in exploring within the GMO ontology.","This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Relevant Modules for Cruise Class:
Event: The Cruise is an event occurring on a vessel. Thus, the Event module is highly relevant.
Cruise: This directly corresponds to the Cruise class in GBO.
Vessel pattern: Since a cruise occurs on a vessel, this module is also relevant.
Relevant Modules for isObserverIn Object Property:
Agent Role: This module deals with roles of agents, which can include being an observer.
Agent: Since an observer is a type of agent, this module might provide relevant properties.
Event: In the context of events, the roles participants play (like being an observer) are often defined.
Cruise: As observers are part of the cruise, this module will have related roles and properties.
Most Relevant Module:
Cruise Module: This module is the most relevant because it directly deals with the Cruise class and includes roles and participation properties, which are essential for mapping the isObserverIn object property.
Conclusion:
The Cruise module in the GMO ontology is the most relevant module that can help us find the corresponding pieces for both the Cruise class and the isObserverIn object property from the GBO ontology.

Would you like a detailed exploration of the Cruise module to identify the exact properties and classes that align with the GBO ontology?

Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context).

I'll start by examining the GMO ontology file to identify relevant classes, properties, and any potential relationships that align with the concepts provided in the GBO ontology. Let's take a look at the GMO ontology file you've uploaded.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue trying to read and display the contents of the GMO ontology file. Let's try a different approach to directly search within the file for related terms such as ""Cruise,"" ""Vessel,"" ""Trajectory,"" ""Organization,"" and any related properties like ""hasOperator"" or their inverses and domains. This way, we can identify any parts of the GMO ontology that might be relevant to your question about connections to the GBO ontology concepts. Let's proceed with this approach. ​​
Error analyzing
It appears we're facing a technical issue when trying to analyze the GMO ontology file for related terms to the GBO ontology you've described. Although my current method isn't working as expected, there are still a few general approaches you can consider to identify related pieces across ontologies:

Manual Inspection: If the ontologies are not excessively large, manually inspecting them for related classes, properties, and relationships can be effective. You would look for semantic similarities or relationships that match or complement the concepts of ""Cruise,"" ""Vessel,"" ""Trajectory,"" ""Organization,"" and related properties in the GBO ontology within the GMO ontology.

Semantic Search Tools: Tools that perform semantic searches over RDF data could be used to query the GMO ontology for terms related to those in the GBO ontology. SPARQL queries, in particular, can be very powerful for this purpose.

Ontology Alignment Tools: There are tools and frameworks designed to find correspondences or alignments between ontologies. These tools can help identify semantically similar concepts across different ontologies by analyzing the structure, labels, and relationships defined in them.

Without direct access to the contents and structure of the GMO ontology, these approaches represent your best options for finding related components between the GMO and GBO ontologies.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises.  First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.

Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent.

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role.

In ontologies, relationships between concepts from different domains (like GMO and GBO) often involve:

Equivalent Classes or Properties: Identifying if there are direct equivalents in GMO for GBO's ""Cruise"" class and ""isOperatorOf"" property.
Subclass or Subproperty Relationships: Checking if GMO contains more specific instances or variations of the general concepts provided by GBO.
Domain and Range Specifications: Analyzing how the properties are used in GMO, including the classes they connect, can provide insights into relatedness, especially for ""isOperatorOf"".
Intersection or Union of Classes: Sometimes, relatedness is expressed through complex class definitions that combine several simpler classes.

Vessel Pattern:

This pattern could be relevant to understand the objects (vessels) involved in the cruises, especially if operational aspects like ownership or operation are considered.
Agent Role:

This module could align with the 'isOperatorOf' object property, which likely describes a role or function an agent (individual or organization) plays concerning operating something, possibly a vessel in the context of a cruise.
Most Relevant Module:
Cruise Module: It is the primary candidate for mapping because it directly addresses the nature of the cruise as an event, making it highly pertinent for integrating or aligning with the 'Cruise' class described in GBO. Moreover, it could potentially incorporate or link to aspects related to operations (like those implied by 'isOperatorOf') by detailing roles or activities within the cruise's context.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.

what objects in the GMO can complete this complex rule? list them
and complete this rule""","The GBO complex rule gbo:Cruise(z) ∧ gbo:isOperatorOf(x, z) implies a relationship where an entity x operates a cruise z. In the GMO ontology, this can be aligned with several patterns and classes that represent the operation of a cruise by an agent, and the roles they perform during such operations. Based on the detailed description of the Cruise micro-ontology and other related patterns in GMO, here's how we can align and complete this rule:

GMO Classes and Object Properties Relevant to the Rule:

Cruise Class: Directly corresponds to the gbo:Cruise class.
Agent Class: Represents the entity (person or organization) that might operate the cruise.
AgentRole Class: Represents roles that an agent can perform, which can be extended to include specific roles like 'Operator' or similar.
Vessel Class: Since the cruise is undertaken by a vessel, this class is crucial for understanding the operational context.
Object Properties in GMO That Could Complete the Rule:

providesAgentRole Object Property: This property can be used to denote that a cruise provides a specific role, such as an operator role.
isPerformedBy Object Property: This aligns with the isOperatorOf in GBO, indicating who performs the role of operator.
isUndertakenBy Object Property: This could be used to link the cruise to the vessel, which is operated by the agent.
Possible Completion of the Complex Rule:

In GMO terms, the rule could be modeled as:
gmo:Cruise(z) ∧ gmo:providesAgentRole(z, y) ∧ gmo:isPerformedBy(x, y) ∧ gmo:AgentRole(y, 'Operator') ∧ gmo:isUndertakenBy(z, v) ∧ gmo:Vessel(v)
Here, y is an instance of AgentRole representing the operator role, x is an agent performing this role, z is the cruise, and v is the vessel undertaking the cruise.
This setup uses the established properties and classes in the GMO ontology to align closely with the GBO rule, ensuring that the agent's role as an operator is clearly linked to the cruise and the vessel. This also preserves the semantic integrity of the roles and their assignments within the context of the GMO ontology's modeling practices.",FALSE,4/4,1,4/6,0.6666666667,,,0,1,,,,,

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology file isn't too large or complex, you might manually inspect it for concepts related to ""Cruise,"" ""hasScheduler,"" ""Vessel,"" ""Trajectory,"" ""Dive,"" and ""Organization."" This can be done using a text editor that supports Turtle syntax highlighting for better visibility.

Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context).

what objects in the GMO can complete this complex rule? list them
and complete this rule""","Based on the detailed information you provided about the GMO ontology and its alignment with the concepts from GBO, the complex rule you are asking to complete involves mapping a 'Cruise' that has a 'Scheduler' (an organization that schedules the cruise) in GBO to corresponding concepts in GMO. Given the structures you've provided:

gbo
correlates with gmo
as both represent the class of cruise events.
gbo
relates to an organization playing a specific role in the context of the cruise.
To complete the rule gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:hasScheduler(x, z) → gmo:?, we would consider the roles and relationships in GMO that involve organizations and their roles in the context of a cruise. From the details shared:

Relevant GMO Concepts:
AgentRole: This class in GMO captures roles played by agents (including organizations) within specific contexts, such as a cruise. Since 'Scheduler' is a role played by an organization in the context of managing or organizing a cruise, this fits well.
providesAgentRole: This object property in GMO could be used to link an entity (like a cruise) with the roles (like scheduler) provided by agents (organizations).
Completing the Complex Rule:
Given these alignments, the completed rule could be expressed in the following way in the GMO ontology context:

css
Copy code
gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:hasScheduler(x, z) → gmo:Cruise(x) ∧ gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y) ∧ gmo:AgentRole(y) ∧ gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z) ∧ gmo:Organization(z)
Here, y is an instance of AgentRole representing the scheduler role, and z is the organization performing this role. The property providesAgentRole connects the cruise to the role, and isPerformedBy connects the role to the organization.

This rule captures the essence of an organization scheduling a cruise by linking the roles and entities through appropriate properties and classes in GMO based on the structure and alignments you've described.",FALSE,4/4,1,4/5,0.8,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

Error analyzing
It looks like we encountered another technical hiccup while trying to retrieve related pieces from the GMO ontology based on your GBO concepts. Given the specific nature of your request, it might involve detailed analysis and specific knowledge of both ontologies' structures and contents, which can be challenging to automate directly without a more tailored approach.

However, if you're looking for connections between concepts like ""Cruise"" or properties such as ""isSchedulerOf"" in the context of ontologies, a manual approach might be more effective. This could involve:

Identifying Key Concepts and Relationships: For each ontology, identify key classes, properties, and instances that are relevant to your domain of interest (e.g., maritime activities, scheduling).

Mapping Between Ontologies: Look for semantic similarities or potential alignments between the concepts in GMO and those in GBO. This might involve finding equivalent classes or properties, or identifying more complex relationships like subclass or subproperty hierarchies.

Leveraging Ontology Tools: There are tools and frameworks designed for ontology alignment, merging, and analysis that can help in identifying relationships between different ontologies. Tools like Protégé, with plugins for ontology alignment, might be useful.

Consulting Domain Experts: Insights from domain experts can be invaluable in understanding the nuances of how concepts in one ontology relate to those in another, especially in specialized domains.

Cruise: This module in GMO is directly relevant as it likely defines cruises in a similar manner to GBO, covering aspects like the nature of cruises, activities involved, and possibly the roles and responsibilities during a cruise.

Agent Role: This module could potentially align with the isSchedulerOf property in GBO, which seems to describe a role or responsibility within the context of a cruise or similar event. The Agent Role module in GMO would define various roles that agents (persons or organizations) can hold, which might include roles related to scheduling or managing events.

Event: Since Cruise in GBO is described as an event, the Event module in GMO might provide a broader context for understanding events, including their planning, execution, and roles involved, which can be useful in understanding the scheduling aspect linked with isSchedulerOf.

Most Relevant Module:

The Cruise module in GMO would be the most relevant to directly align with the GBO Cruise class due to the likely shared focus on maritime or research events. This module would provide the foundational elements to explore and map details such as roles, activities, and properties directly related to cruises.
These modules should provide a good starting point for aligning and mapping the GBO details with the GMO ontology. Would you like to explore specific properties or classes within these modules further?","""Given this below information about GMO,

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 

In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.

Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

what objects in the GMO can complete this complex rule? list them
and complete this rule""""""","To complete the alignment and provide a comprehensive mapping for the rule gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:isSchedulerOf(x, z) → gmo:?, we need to identify GMO ontology components that can conceptually match both the GBO's Cruise class and the isSchedulerOf object property. Here’s a detailed approach to this alignment based on the information provided:

Components from GMO to Consider:
Cruise Class in GMO

Aligns directly with gbo:Cruise as both describe the concept of a cruise, although the GMO's version may have a broader or slightly different conceptual scope.
Agent Role Class in GMO

This class would be essential for representing the role being performed (e.g., Scheduler) as it captures roles performed by agents within specific contexts, which can include cruises.
Object Properties in GMO Related to Agent Roles and Events:

providesAgentRole: This property could represent the connection between a cruise and the roles it offers, potentially aligning with the concept of isSchedulerOf in a broader sense where a cruise provides various roles including that of a scheduler.
isPerformedBy: This property links agent roles to the agents performing them, which would be necessary to map the z in gbo:isSchedulerOf(x, z), indicating who performs the role of scheduler.
AgentRole isAgentRoleIn: This property could link the role of Scheduler directly to the Cruise, suggesting that the role is a part of the cruise's operations.
Completing the Complex Rule:
Given the described properties and classes, the complex rule could be completed as follows in the GMO:

sparql
Copy code
gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:isSchedulerOf(x, z) → gmo:Cruise(x) ∧ gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y) ∧ gmo:AgentRole(y) ∧ gmo:isAgentRoleIn(y, x) ∧ gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z)
Explanation:
gmo:Cruise(x): Directly asserts that x is a Cruise in GMO.
gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y): The Cruise x provides an Agent Role y, which is the role of a Scheduler.
gmo:AgentRole(y): Asserts that y is an Agent Role within GMO.
gmo:isAgentRoleIn(y, x): Connects the Agent Role y specifically to the Cruise x, establishing the context of the role.
gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z): Completes the rule by linking the Agent Role y to the Agent z, indicating that z is the performer of the Scheduler role within the context of the Cruise.
This proposed rule aligns the components of the GBO ontology with those in the GMO ontology, ensuring that the roles and events are mapped effectively across both ontological frameworks.

Since the key components you mentioned are a class named Cruise and an object property named hasTechnician, I'll look for similar or related concepts, properties, and relationships in the GMO ontology.

I will now analyze the contents of the GMO file to identify any related classes, properties, or relationships. Let's start by examining the GMO ontology file you've uploaded.

It seems there was an issue with accessing the content of the GMO ontology file directly for analysis. Unfortunately, without being able to read the file directly in this environment, I can't automatically analyze its contents to identify related parts to the GBO ontology you've described.

However, if you can provide specific details or questions about the GMO ontology, such as the names of classes, properties, or any particular patterns you're interested in, I can guide you on how to manually find connections or suggest what kinds of relationships and entities to look for. For instance, you could search the GMO ontology for:

Classes related to ""Vessel"" or ""Trajectory"": Since Cruise is an event occurring on a Vessel traversing a Trajectory, any classes or properties related to these concepts in GMO could be relevant.
Properties involving ""Person"" as a domain or range: The hasTechnician property in GBO connects a Cruise to a Person. Similar properties in GMO that involve people could be of interest.
Inverse properties: Since hasTechnician has an inverse of isTechnicianOf, looking for properties in GMO with defined inverses might reveal related structures.

Cruise - This module is directly relevant as it defines the 'Cruise' class in the GMO ontology, which would correspond to the 'Cruise' class in the GBO ontology where cruises are described as events occurring on a vessel.

Agent and Agent Role - These modules are crucial for defining the roles and participants in any event, including a cruise. Since 'hasTechnician' links a cruise to a person serving in a technical capacity, these modules can help define and contextualize the role of a technician within a cruise setting.

Person - This module is essential because the 'hasTechnician' object property specifically ranges to a person, making the Person module necessary for detailing the properties and characteristics of individuals involved in a cruise.

Most Relevant Module:
The Cruise module is the most relevant module for directly mapping the 'Cruise' class from the GBO ontology. It likely contains the properties and context needed to understand the event of a cruise and its connection to various roles like technicians through the broader definitions of agent roles within the Cruise context.

Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary.

For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.

Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

what objects in the GMO can complete this complex rule? list them
and complete this rule""","To align the GBO triples gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:hasTechnician(x, z) with the corresponding objects in the GMO ontology, let's first understand the intent of these relationships:

gbo:Cruise(x) denotes an instance x of a cruise.
gbo:hasTechnician(x, z) indicates that a technician z (a Person) is associated with the cruise x.
Considering the detailed description of the GMO ontology provided, particularly focusing on the Agent Role pattern and the Cruise micro-ontology, we can look for a suitable alignment. Here's a possible completion of this rule based on the GMO components:

Target Rule:
gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ gbo:hasTechnician(x, z) → gmo:Cruise(x) ∧ gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y) ∧ gmo:AgentRole(y) ∧ gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z) ∧ gmo:Agent(z)

Explanation:
gmo:Cruise(x):

Directly aligns with gbo:Cruise(x), acknowledging that x is a cruise event.
gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y):

This property would indicate that the cruise x offers various agent roles, one of which is the technician role y.
gmo:AgentRole(y):

Identifies y as an agent role. We can further specify that y is a 'Technician' role if GMO allows for defining specific types of roles. If not, it remains a generic agent role which can be specialized through other properties or descriptions.
gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z):

Establishes that the role y (technician) is performed by z, which directly maps to the gbo:hasTechnician relationship.
gmo:Agent(z):

Confirms that z is an agent, which in the context of GMO, would correspond to a person fulfilling a role.
Additional Components:
You may also incorporate temporal properties if the role of the technician is time-bounded, such as:

gmo:startsAtTime(y, t1) and gmo:endsAtTime(y, t2) to specify the duration of the technician role within the cruise.
Depending on the details available in the GMO for defining roles more precisely, additional subclass or property specifications could be added to further qualify the type of agent role (Technician), possibly through a separate pattern or an extension of the AgentRole class.

This mapping utilizes the Agent Role pattern and the Cruise micro-ontology's ability to align with events and roles, providing a detailed and robust alignment to the GBO structure.

Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered a technical hiccup while trying to process the GMO ontology file and find related pieces to the GBO ontology you mentioned. This issue is preventing me from directly accessing and analyzing the content of the GMO ontology as intended.

Given this limitation, I can offer a general approach on how to manually identify related parts between two ontologies such as GMO and GBO:

Identify Key Concepts: Start by identifying the key concepts in GBO that you're interested in, which you've already done with ""Cruise"" and ""isTechnicianOf"".

Search for Semantic Similarities: Look for classes or properties in GMO that are semantically related to these concepts. For ""Cruise"", you might look for terms related to travel, vessels, or events. For ""isTechnicianOf"", you might look for properties that denote employment or roles within an event or organization.

Compare Definitions and Hierarchies: Check the definitions (comments) and hierarchies (subclass or subproperty relationships) in GMO for matches or closely related concepts to those in GBO.

Use Ontology Tools: Utilize ontology editors and tools like Protégé, which can help in searching and exploring ontologies for specific classes, properties, or relationships that match or are related to your terms of interest.

Look for Ontology Mappings: In some cases, ontologies might have mappings between them, especially if they're in related domains. These mappings can provide direct links between concepts in different ontologies.

If you have specific parts of the GMO ontology in mind or can provide more details about what constitutes a ""related"" piece in this context, I could offer more targeted advice. Otherwise, following the above steps manually using an ontology editor might be your best bet.","""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

For the GBO pieces related to the 'Cruise' class and 'isTechnicianOf' object property, the most relevant modules from the GMO ontology are:

Cruise Module: Directly relevant to the 'Cruise' class in GBO as it would contain similar definitions, properties, and structure centered around the concept of a cruise, which is defined as an event occurring on a vessel.

Agent Role Module: This module could provide relevant properties and class definitions related to different roles that agents (individuals or entities) play, which would be pertinent to understanding the 'isTechnicianOf' property. It likely includes roles that agents can have during a cruise or related event.

Vessel Pattern: Since the 'Cruise' in GBO occurs on a vessel, this module could provide additional context or properties related to the vessel involved in such events.

Event Module: This might provide broader context on how events like cruises are modeled in terms of temporal and participatory aspects, which could intersect with the description and structuring of a cruise in GBO.

Among these, the Cruise Module in the GMO ontology is likely the most directly relevant module to help you find alignments and mappings related to both the 'Cruise' class and the 'isTechnicianOf' property in GBO, as it would specifically cover the domain of cruising activities and roles associated within such events.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 

In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.

Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern.

The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospatial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern.

Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. 



Some of the axioms relevant to the cruise trajectory are obtained by reusing, with some modifications, the axioms of from Semantic Trajectory pattern [Hu et al., 2013]. For clarity and completeness, we will restate those axioms here as needed.
We begin describing the cruise trajectory by defining its basic components: fixes and segments. A fix has a location and a time stamp, and always belongs to one particular trajectory. Also, a fix cannot be followed by more than one other fix, and cannot follow itself. This gives a linear structure in the ordering of the fixes.
Fix ⊑ ∃hasLocation.Position ⊓ ∃atTime.TimeEntity ⊓ (=1 hasFix−.Trajectory) Fix ⊑ (61 nextFix.Fix) ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.Self
We next define starting and ending fixes as special kinds of fixes.
StartingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix−.⊤ EndingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.⊤
StartingFix ⊓ EndingFix ⊑ ⊥
A trajectory is linked to at least two consecutive fixes where the first fix is the starting fix. Also,
belongs to a trajectory, then its successor fix also belongs to the same trajectory.
Trajectory ⊑ ∃hasFix.(StartingFix ⊓ ∃nextFix.Fix) hasFix ◦ nextFix ⊑ hasFix

A segment starts from exactly one fix, and for every fix with a successor fix, there is a segment that starts from it. If a fix belongs to a trajectory and there is a segment that starts from this fix, then the segment belongs to the trajectory. Furthermore, if a segment starts from a fix, then it ends at the successor of the fix.
Segment ⊑ (=1 startsFrom.Fix) ∃nextFix.Fix ⊑ (=1 startsFrom−.Segment)
hasFix ◦ startsFrom− ⊑ hasSegment startsFrom ◦ nextFix ⊑ endsAt

The above axiomatization ensures that a trajectory is linked to all of its fixes and segments. Note that the above axioms do not model a trajectory to have a finite sequence of fixes of unknown length, which cannot actually be modeled in OWL 2. In our case, however, data providers will only provide cruise trajectory as a finite collection of fixes with a known ordering, which can be written as a set of ABox axioms of the form Fix(f1), . . . , Fix(fn), nextFix(f1, f2), . . . , nextFix(fn−1, fn), StartingFix(f1), EndingFix(fn). Since a fix cannot have more than one successor fix, we implicitly obtain a finite, linear ordering given by the transitive closure of nextFix.
We next define atPort as a shortcut via property chain involving hasLocation and hasSpatialFootprint, which can be written in Datalog as: hasLocation(x, y), hasSpatialFootprint(z, y), Port(z) → atPort(x, z). The following two axioms express the rule where rollifiedPort is a fresh property name defined solely for the class Port, which is defined as a subclass of Place.
hasLocation ◦ hasSpatialFootprint− ◦ rollifiedPort ⊑ atPort ∃rollifiedPort.Self ≡ Port

We assert that a cruise is an event through the alignment with Event pattern (see Section 13.4.3). We then assert that a cruise has exactly one trajectory, is undertaken by exactly one vessel, and is described by exactly one InformationObject. Additionally, this instance of InformationObject describes exactly only the cruise. We also assert that if a cruise is undertaken by a vessel, then the trajectory of the cruise has to be traveled by the vessel.

Note that since isTraveledBy is implied by a property chain, OWL 2 specification forbids us to express a cardinality restriction using this peroperty. Consequently, we cannot axiomatize that the trajectory of a cruise can only be traveled by one vessel. Next, we state the guarded domain and range restrictions for the properties mentioned above.

Event Pattern: Since the cruise itself is defined as an event, the Event pattern is central to understanding the temporal and activity aspects of the cruise, which could be related to port calls.

Information Object Pattern: This pattern is used to describe various non-event aspects of the cruise, such as funding, programs, and related cruises, which could be valuable for describing the broader context of a port call.

Vessel Pattern: As the vessel is a crucial part of the cruise, this pattern describes the vessel's physical properties and roles, which would be directly relevant to a port call, given that the vessel's characteristics and operations are integral to such activities.

Place Pattern: The port, being a specific place, would naturally relate to the Place pattern, especially in terms of geospatial features and non-geospatial information like names and web pages.

Trajectory and Segment Patterns: These patterns are particularly relevant as they deal with the trajectory of the cruise, including fixes (specific points in time and space along the cruise path), which are crucial for defining the starting and ending points of port calls.

The axiomatization involving atPort as a property chain (hasLocation, hasSpatialFootprint, rollifiedPort leading to atPort) suggests that you could leverage the linkage between places and events described in these patterns to model the interaction of a vessel with a port during a cruise in the GBO ontology. This connection would use spatial and temporal details along with the physical and operational characteristics of the vessel, aligning with how port calls are conceptualized within the context of cruises.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,didn't point exactly,,0,1,,,,,

It seems I'm unable to directly read and analyze the content of the GMO ontology file due to a technical issue. Without directly accessing the file's content, I can't specifically identify the pieces in the GMO ontology that directly relate to your GBO ontology details.

However, I can offer a general approach to how you might find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the triples from the GBO ontology you provided:

Identify Key Concepts and Properties: In your GBO ontology, the key concepts are ""PortCall"" and ""Place"", and the key property is ""atPort"". Look for similar or related concepts in the GMO ontology.

Search for Object Properties: The GBO ontology mentions ""atPort"" as an object property with an inverse of ""isPortOf"". Look for any object properties in the GMO ontology that have similar domain and range, or that are described as inverses of each other.

Domain and Range Matching: The GBO ontology specifies ""PortCall"" as the domain and ""Place"" as the range for ""atPort"". In the GMO ontology, look for properties with similar domain and range definitions.

Check for Comments and Labels: The comment in the GBO ontology provides context about the ""atPort"" property's role. Similar comments or labels in the GMO ontology might hint at related concepts or properties.

InverseOf Relationships: Since ""atPort"" is an inverse of ""isPortOf"", search the GMO ontology for properties that are defined as inverses, which could indicate a similar relational structure.

For a more precise matching, it would be necessary to directly analyze the GMO ontology's content.

The Place pattern is intended to describe place of interests (POIs) that is associated with certain geospatial features. At this stage, however, we have not yet developed a more precise specification of this pattern, and plan to do so as a future work. In this version, we model a place simply as something that is described by some information object, which allows us to attach non-geospatial information (e.g., name, web page, etc.), and may have some spatial footprint, which is a geometric feature in space, e.g., a point, a line, a polygon, etc. For now, we omit the detailed specification of Geometry, which may need its own pattern. The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1. 


This is a simple pattern describing events. The modeling approach is based on the Simple Event Model (SEM) [van Hage et al., 2011]. Essentially, an event occurs at some place and some time. Also, an event may provide roles performed by agents. This relationship is modeled based on the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) to which the Event pattern is aligned. When reusing this pattern, one may also restrict tbe set of all possible agent-role type an event may have, so that all agent-roles the event provides only come from that set, as described in Section 2.5, although this is not at all enforced in this pattern. 
Information about place and time of an event is modeled in a generic way. For the former, we define the Place class as a hook to the Place pattern describing a generic place or point-of-interest. For the latter, we define the TimeInstant class as a hook to time:Instant from OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006]. Time interval is accommodated through the startsAtTime and endsAtTime property. Note that these two are different from the properties with a similar name defined in the ⟨AgentRole⟩ pattern. 
The Event pattern is (re-)used by Person pattern (Chapter 6) to model birth event. The Cruise pattern (Chapter 13) also uses this pattern. 
The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].

It looks like I'm encountering an issue with processing the GMO ontology in relation to the ""isPortOf"" property from the GBO ontology. This could be due to a variety of technical reasons. However, I can guide you on how you might approach this task manually or with another tool:

Identify Similar Properties: Look for properties in GMO that have similar names or labels to ""isPortOf"". This could involve searching for properties related to ports, connections, or associations between entities.

Check for Object Properties: Since ""isPortOf"" is an object property in GBO, similar object properties in GMO would be relevant. You would look for properties defined with rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty.

Examine Domain and Range: For any properties you identify as potentially related, check their domain and range definitions. Similarities in these areas might indicate a relevant connection to ""isPortOf"".

Look for Equivalent Properties: The GMO ontology might explicitly define some properties as equivalent to ""isPortOf"" using owl:equivalentProperty.

Search for Sub-properties: Properties in GMO that are sub-properties (rdfs:subPropertyOf) of a similar concept might also be relevant.

The above axiomatization ensures that a trajectory is linked to all of its fixes and segments. Note that the above axioms do not model a trajectory to have a finite sequence of fixes of unknown length, which cannot actually be modeled in OWL 2. In our case, however, data providers will only provide cruise trajectory as a finite collection of fixes with a known ordering, which can be written as a set of ABox axioms of the form Fix(f1), . . . , Fix(fn), nextFix(f1, f2), . . . , nextFix(fn−1, fn), StartingFix(f1), EndingFix(fn).

The intention is to have Geometry aligned to the GeoSPARQL standard1. 
 The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14. Each vessel can be described in terms of observable (physical) properties, e.g., length, beam, draft, and displacement. We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit. The modeling of these properties can also be aligned to the QUDT – Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies1. 
A vessel may provide some agent-roles performed by some agents. An obvious example, a vessel most likely has an owner or affiliated with an organization. This modeled by re-using the Agent Role pattern. 
Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc. ","Given the detailed information about the GMO ontology and the focus on port-related concepts, we can align the relevant pieces in GMO to the isPortOf object property in the GBO ontology.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth.

It seems I'm currently unable to directly access and read the contents of the GMO ontology file due to an unexpected error. However, we can still proceed by discussing the key elements you've mentioned in the GBO ontology and how you might find related pieces in the GMO ontology or any other ontology.

is the inverse of main:isSampleTypeOf,
has a domain of main:PhysicalSample, and
has a range of main:PhysicalSampleType,
with a label ""hasSampleType"".
In general, when looking for related parts in another ontology (like GMO), you would search for:

Equivalent or related object properties: Look for properties in GMO that serve a similar role to hasSampleType, especially those related to the classification or categorization of samples.
Inverse relationships: Search for properties that are defined as inverses of ones related to sample type categorization.
Domain and range similarities: Identify classes in GMO that correspond to PhysicalSample and PhysicalSampleType from GBO. This might include looking for classes that represent physical entities or categorizations thereof.
Label and naming conventions: Sometimes, related concepts can be identified by similar naming conventions or labels, even across different ontologies.
Since I can't access the file directly, you could manually search the GMO ontology for these elements.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

It appears we're encountering technical difficulties with processing the GMO ontology file to find pieces related to the isSampleTypeOf property from the GBO ontology. This could be due to several factors, such as file format issues, compatibility, or limitations within the current environment.

While I'm unable to directly parse and analyze the ontology file at this moment, we can discuss general strategies to identify related parts between two ontologies:

Semantic Similarity: Look for properties or classes in the GMO ontology that semantically relate to ""isSampleTypeOf"". This could involve properties related to sample types, categorization, or association between entities.

Label and Comment Inspection: Sometimes, relationships between entities in different ontologies are hinted at through labels (rdfs:label) or comments (rdfs:comment). Inspecting these annotations for mentions of sample types or related concepts could be useful.

Equivalent and Sub-Properties: In OWL, properties can be related through owl:equivalentProperty or hierarchical relationships (rdfs:subPropertyOf). Check if isSampleTypeOf or a similar property in GBO has an equivalent or is a sub-property of another property in GMO.

Manual Mapping: In cases where automated methods are challenging, manual inspection and mapping based on domain knowledge might be necessary. This involves analyzing the definitions and usage of properties and classes in both ontologies to identify potential relations.

For more detailed analysis or assistance, it might be helpful to use ontology editing and analysis tools like Protégé, which provide a graphical interface for exploring and editing ontologies, and could offer more insights into the relationships between different ontological entities.

The most relevant module names from the list provided would likely involve entities that can have samples or types as properties.

Here are the modules and patterns that could be relevant:

Physical Sample pattern: This is the most directly related module because it deals with physical samples, which aligns with the ""isSampleTypeOf"" property.
Property Value pattern: This module might also be relevant since it could involve properties and values that are associated with samples or types.
Based on this analysis, the most relevant module that can help in finding the relevant pieces is the Physical Sample pattern. This pattern will likely contain definitions and properties related to samples, which is directly aligned with the isSampleTypeOf property in GBO.","Given this below information about GMO, 


The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

Firstly, we define that a PhysicalSample should be originated from some Feature. ∃originatesFrom.Feature ⊑ PhysicalSample

PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀originatesFrom.Feature
A PhysicalSample should also be derived from a SamplingProcess. Thus, we have the following axioms.
∃derivedUsing.SamplingProcess ⊑ PhysicalSample PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀derivedUsing.SamplingProcess
A SamplingProcess has exactly an input Feature, and should derive an output PhysicalSample. SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)isInputFeatureOf−.Feature
SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)derivedUsing−.PhysicalSample A PhysicalSample is a subclass of a Feature which is a subclass of things.
PhysicalSample ⊑ Feature Feature ⊑ ⊤
When a Feature is the input feature of a SamplingProcess which derive another PhysicalSample, we say the PhysicalSample originates from the Feature.
derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom
A PhysicalSample can have InformationObject which provides additional information about the PhysicalSample. Similarly, it can also have Property to describe some attributes, such as material type, color, age, and so forth.
PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀hasProperty.Property

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as """"Age"""" and """"Material Type"""". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. 

can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:isSampleTypeOf(x,y)  → gmo:?""","Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, specifically focusing on the Physical Sample pattern and the Property Value pattern, here are the relevant pieces in GMO that can be related to gbo:isSampleTypeOf(x,y):

A PhysicalSample can have properties that describe its type, material, age, and other attributes.
PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject

A PhysicalSample can be described by an InformationObject, providing additional details like name and ID, which may relate to the type of sample.
Sample Mapping
Given the gbo:isSampleTypeOf(x, y) relationship, where x is a sample and y is its type, the most relevant mapping in GMO would likely involve linking a PhysicalSample (x) to a Property (y) through the ecglps:hasProperty property.

Here is a possible mapping in GMO:

gbo
(x, y) → ecglps
(x, y)
x would be an instance of ecglps:PhysicalSample.
y would be an instance of ecglps:Property, representing the type of the sample.
Example
If you have a specific sample (e.g., a soil sample), and you want to specify its type (e.g., clay), the mapping would look like this:

gbo
(SoilSample, Clay) → ecglps
(SoilSample, ClayProperty)
Where SoilSample is an instance of ecglps:PhysicalSample, and ClayProperty is a subclass of ecglps:Property.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find the pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts you've shared from the GBO ontology, specifically the PhysicalSample class and the hasCollector object property, I'll need to examine the contents of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded.

Let's start by reviewing the GMO ontology to identify any classes, properties, or other elements that may be related to physical samples and their collectors, such as corresponding classes, object properties with similar domains and ranges, or comments that mention similar concepts. I'll look for matches or connections based on the descriptions you've provided from the GBO ontology.

Error analyzing
It looks like I'm encountering difficulties processing the GMO ontology file as intended. Given these technical challenges, I can't directly extract and analyze the content in real-time as hoped.

However, typically, to find elements in the GMO ontology that relate to parts of the GBO ontology like PhysicalSample and hasCollector, you would:

Look for Classes Similar to PhysicalSample: Identify any classes in the GMO ontology that are used to represent physical objects or samples that can be collected, observed, or preserved.
Examine Object Properties: Search for object properties that resemble hasCollector, focusing on those that link physical objects or samples to entities like persons or collectors. This includes properties that indicate who collected a sample or who is associated with it in some capacity.
Review Comments and Labels: Pay attention to comments (rdfs:comment) and labels (rdfs:label) within the GMO ontology that mention terms like ""sample,"" ""collector,"" or related concepts. These can provide hints about the ontology's structure and how it models similar ideas.
Analyze Domain and Range: For object properties, analyze their domain (rdfs:domain) and range (rdfs:range) definitions. Properties in the GMO ontology that have a domain of physical samples or similar entities and a range of persons (or similar roles) could be analogous to hasCollector.
Check for Inverse Properties: If the GMO ontology defines inverse properties (using owl:inverseOf), look for any that might be inversely related to a property similar to hasCollector.
Without direct access to the content, this general approach can guide you in manually reviewing the GMO ontology or using RDF tools and queries to find related concepts.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 


The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed. ObjectProperty: hasPersonalInfoItem ObjectProperty: hasCredential ObjectProperty: hasBirthEvent ObjectProperty: occursAtPlace ObjectProperty: occursAtTime ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: Person Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole

Class: Person Class: PersonalInfoItem Class: Credential Class: BirthEvent Class: Place Class: TimeInstant Class: AgentRole Class: BornPersonRole 


The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship. 
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

Error analyzing

This analysis involves complex operations, such as parsing the ontology file, executing RDF queries, and interpreting semantic relationships, which might require a more detailed and specific approach than initially anticipated.

However, I can provide some general advice on how you might proceed:

Similarity in Concepts or Labels: Look for classes or properties in the GMO ontology with labels or comments that resemble PhysicalSample or isCollectorOf. This could involve searching for terms related to physical objects, samples, collectors, or collection activities.
Structural Relationships: Examine the ontology for object properties that might serve a similar role as isCollectorOf, connecting entities in a way that implies a collection or cataloguing action.
Domain Overlap: Consider areas where the domains of GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) and GBO (the context you've provided suggests it's related to biological samples) might overlap, such as in the cataloguing of genetically modified samples or the tracking of specimen data.
Semantic Annotations: Review any semantic annotations or ontology metadata that might suggest connections or equivalences between entities in the two ontologies.
Use RDF Query Languages: If you're familiar with RDF query languages like SPARQL, you could write queries to systematically search for these relationships within the GMO ontology. For instance, querying for all classes and properties, then filtering by those with labels or descriptions that hint at a connection to the concepts of interest from GBO.

can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:PhysicalSample(z) ∧ gbo:isCollectorOf (x, z) ↔","Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, here are the related pieces in the GMO ontology that correspond to the given GBO ontology parts gbo:PhysicalSample(z) ∧ gbo:isCollectorOf(x, z):

Relevant Classes and Properties in GMO Ontology:
PhysicalSample Pattern in GMO:

Class: ecglps
: This class directly corresponds to gbo:PhysicalSample.
Class: ecglps
: This could relate to the process of collecting or generating a physical sample.
Class: ecglps
: Since PhysicalSample is a subclass of Feature, this could also be relevant.
Class: ecglps
: Provides additional information about a physical sample.
Class: ecglps
: Includes properties of a physical sample like material type, age, etc.

Agent Role Pattern in GMO:

Class: ecglag
: Corresponds to agents, which could be collectors in the GBO ontology.
Class: ecglag
: Defines roles that agents (collectors) perform.
ObjectProperty: ecglag
: Indicates the roles an agent performs.
ObjectProperty: ecglar
: Indicates the agent performing a role.
Mapping to GBO Ontology:
gbo
(z): Corresponds to ecglps:PhysicalSample in GMO.
gbo
(x, z):
x (the collector) corresponds to ecglag:Agent or ecglag:AgentRole in GMO.
z (the physical sample) corresponds to ecglps:PhysicalSample in GMO.
The relationship gbo:isCollectorOf can be mapped to the properties in the Agent Role pattern, such as ecglag:performsAgentRole and ecglar:isPerformedBy.
Conclusion:
To find the relevant pieces in GMO that relate to gbo:PhysicalSample(z) ∧ gbo:isCollectorOf(x, z), you should look into the following parts of the GMO ontology:

ecglps:PhysicalSample
ecglag:Agent
ecglag:AgentRole
Properties such as ecglag:performsAgentRole and ecglar:isPerformedBy.
These components in GMO should provide the necessary details to map the relationships and properties defined in the GBO ontology .Explanation:
gbo
(z):

This corresponds directly to ecglps:PhysicalSample(z) in the GMO ontology.
gbo
(x, z):

x is an agent (collector), which corresponds to ecglag:Agent(x) in GMO.
The relationship that x is a collector of z can be represented through the role pattern in GMO, where an agent performs a role related to a physical sample.
This relationship can be captured by the combination of ecglag:performsAgentRole(x, y) and ecglar:isPerformedBy(y, z):
ecglag:performsAgentRole(x, y) indicates that x (the agent) performs a role y.
ecglar:isPerformedBy(y, z) indicates that the role y is performed by z (the physical sample).
So the rule essentially states that for a physical sample z and a collector x:

z is a physical sample in the GMO ontology.
x is an agent who performs a role related to collecting the physical sample z.
This mapping ensures that the GBO ontology concepts are accurately represented using the GMO ",FALSE,3/4,0.75,3/4,0.75,,,4/5,0.2,,,,,

Most Relevant Module:

For finding relevant pieces related to the PhysicalSample in the GBO ontology, the Physical Sample pattern module in the GMO ontology would be most relevant.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion.

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization.

It seems I encountered an unexpected issue trying to directly access and read the contents of the GMO ontology file you uploaded. Although I can't directly examine the file due to this hiccup, we can still discuss a general approach you might use to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology segments you've provided.

General Approach to Find Related Pieces in Ontologies
Identify Key Concepts and Properties:
From your GBO segments, the key concepts are PhysicalSample and the relationship hasContributor (and its inverse isContributorOf). Identify similar concepts in GMO, such as classes or properties related to physical samples or contribution.
Search for Semantic Similarities:
Use tools or manual inspection to search the GMO ontology for classes or properties with names or descriptions that resemble ""physical sample"" or ""contributor."" This can involve searching for specific keywords or using semantic similarity tools.
Examine Relationships:
Look for properties in GMO that define relationships similar to hasContributor, especially those indicating a contribution relationship. Pay attention to the domain and range of these properties to ensure they match the context of physical samples or similar entities.
Review Documentation or Metadata:
If available, review any documentation or metadata associated with the GMO ontology. It might provide insights into the ontology's structure or highlight related concepts.
Use Ontology Tools:
Consider using ontology management tools like Protégé or WebVOWL to visually explore the GMO ontology. These tools can help identify related classes and properties by visualizing the ontology's structure.
Leverage SPARQL Queries:
If you're familiar with SPARQL, you can write queries to programmatically search for related concepts in the GMO ontology. For example, you can query for classes related to physical samples or properties indicating a contribution relationship.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify related pieces in the GMO ontology. If you can share more specific details or concepts you're interested in within the GMO ontology, I can provide more directed advice. ​","""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Analysis:
PhysicalSample:

Physical Sample pattern: This module is most likely related to the PhysicalSample class in the GBO ontology. It likely contains information about physical samples, their properties, and how they are catalogued or preserved.
hasContributor:

Agent: This module could be relevant as contributors are typically agents (e.g., individuals, organizations).
Person: Since the range of hasContributor is Person, this module might define individuals who could be contributors.
Organization: Contributors can also be organizations, making this module potentially relevant.
Agent Role: This module might define roles that agents (persons or organizations) can play, including being contributors.
Most Relevant Module:
For finding the most relevant pieces related to the PhysicalSample class and the hasContributor property from the GBO ontology, the Physical Sample pattern module is the most relevant. It directly pertains to physical samples and is likely to contain related properties and metadata.

The Agent and Person modules are also relevant for exploring relationships involving contributors.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 



The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

GMO Class: ecglps
The ecglps:PhysicalSample class in the GMO ontology is directly related to the gbo:PhysicalSample class in the GBO ontology.
GBO Object Property: hasCurator

To find the equivalent property in the GMO ontology, we should look for properties that link a physical sample to an agent responsible for it.

This combination effectively represents the curator role in relation to a physical sample in the GMO ontology.

Explanation:
gmo:ecglps

This class corresponds to the gbo:PhysicalSample and represents the physical sample in the GMO ontology.
gmo:ecglag

This property represents the role performed by an agent. In this context, it can be used to identify the curator role.
gmo:ecglps

This property links the physical sample to an information object, which can include details about the curator.

By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent


The Information Object pattern in Figure 4.1 models the additional information assigned to an object. Essentially, any thing can be described by an information object, and the information object in turn carries adornment, such as descriptions and webpages, about the target thing. The notion of information object is inspired by the information object component of the DOLCE ontology [Oberle et al., 2007]. In the future, this pattern can be aligned to the W3C Prov-O. 
Everything can have at most one information object associated with it. However, one information ob- ject can have one or more information realizations, such as csv files, word documents, and database ta- bles. We consider the class DigitalObject in the Digital Object pattern as a subclass of InformationReal- ization. This will be asserted not in this pattern, but rather in the alignment from Digital Object pattern to this pattern later. Currently, this pattern stub provides a number of properties whose range is either strings or URIs. The property hasDescription provides a simple string description of any instance. The properties hasWebpage and seeAlso provide URL information that can be used to find further informa- tion. The property hasCanonicalName provides the canonical name of an instance as string. The property alsoKnownAs provides a string that can be used as an alternative name aside from the one provided by hasCanonicalName. Identifier of an object (not the information object that described it) can also be included via hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier property. The detail of identifier is modeled by a separate Identifier pattern in Chapter 5. 



The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To accurately identify the pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts you've described in the GBO ontology, I would need to analyze the contents of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. I'll start by examining the GMO ontology to find any classes, object properties, or other elements that are semantically related or have a direct connection to the PhysicalSample class and the hasRightsHolder object property as described in the GBO ontology.

Let's begin by reviewing the content of the GMO ontology file you provided.
Error analyzing
Error analyzing
It seems I encountered an unexpected issue trying to read the file. Instead of attempting to directly read the contents again, I'll proceed by discussing how you can identify related pieces in your GMO ontology based on the description of the GBO ontology you provided.

The GBO ontology describes a PhysicalSample class with a specific purpose and metadata schema reference, and a hasRightsHolder object property that connects various types of resources to their rights holders, which could be organizations or persons.

To find related pieces in the GMO ontology, you would look for:

Classes similar to PhysicalSample: Search for classes that are described as physical objects, samples, or any resource that can be observed, preserved, and cataloged. The description provided in GBO highlights the importance of preservation and metadata schema adherence, so any class with similar characteristics in GMO would be relevant.
Object properties akin to hasRightsHolder: Look for object properties that establish ownership, rights, or responsibilities over resources. This includes properties that link resources (like datasets, digital objects, documents, or samples) to entities such as organizations or individuals. The object property may not have the exact name but look for properties with similar domain and range specifications.
Metadata schema references: If the GMO ontology includes references to external metadata schemas (like the IGSN metadata schema mentioned in GBO), those parts of the ontology are likely related to the management, description, and identification of samples or resources.
Inverse properties and domain/range specifications: Similar to hasRightsHolder and its inverse isRightsHolderOf, look for properties in GMO that have explicitly defined inverse relationships or detailed domain and range specifications that align with those in GBO.
Unfortunately, without direct access to the GMO ontology contents at this moment, these guidelines are the best approach to manually inspect the GMO file for related elements. If you can provide specific details or questions about elements within the GMO ontology, I might be able to offer more directed advice","""This is a list of all the modules and patterns that are defined in GMO ontology: such as:

Among these, the most relevant module to start with for finding related pieces is the Physical Sample pattern. This module will likely contain information and relationships pertaining to physical samples, which is directly analogous to the PhysicalSample class in GBO. Additionally, checking the Agent module could help identify how rights holders (organizations and persons) are modeled, relating to the hasRightsHolder property in GBO.

Let's start by examining the Physical Sample pattern module for related pieces.","""Given this below information about GMO,

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

The Agent Role pattern describes a role that may be performed by an agent within a particular context, i.e., in an organization, a cruise, a project, etc. Such a role is temporally restricted, i.e., an AgentRole starts at one TimeInstant and ends at one TimeInstant. 
An AgentRole is performed by exactly one Agent. An AgentRole is an agent-role in exactly one context (we simply use owl:Thing to cover such a context). For the inverse relationship, a thing (e.g., orgnaization, cruise, etc.) may provide an agent-role, although in this case, it may provide more than one agent-role. Alignment of the Agent Role pattern with Agent pattern and OWL Time ontology [Hobbs and Pan, 2006] are respectively depcited in 2.3 Figure 2.3.

The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property). 
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization. 
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern. 
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for  an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through 
the hasSubOrganization property.

 can you complete this rule gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:hasRightsHolder(x, z) ↔    gmo:?

","To complete the rule gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:hasRightsHolder(x, z) ↔ gmo:?, we need to map the elements from the GBO ontology to the GMO ontology. From the provided GMO ontology information, we can identify relevant classes and properties.

Here's a breakdown:

gbo

gbo

Considering the relevant modules, particularly the Physical Sample pattern and the Agent pattern, we can establish the mapping.

Rule Completion
In the GMO ontology, a physical sample is described by an information object and is associated with agents (organizations or persons) via agent roles. The hasRightsHolder relationship in GBO can be mapped to an agent role in GMO, where the agent (person or organization) has a role related to the physical sample.

Thus, the rule can be completed as follows:

gbo:hasRightsHolder(x, z): Maps to gmo:hasAgentRole(x, z) where z is an agent (either a gmo:Person or gmo:Organization).
Let's make sure we use the appropriate prefixes and class/property names. Based on the provided GMO information:

gmo:hasAgentRole might be used as gmo:providesAgentRole or similar properties depending on the exact model details.

Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering an issue with processing the file you've provided, preventing me from directly querying the GMO ontology for related concepts to the GBO ontology you mentioned. This might be due to a specific handling or parsing error within the environment I'm using.

Given these challenges, there are a few alternative approaches we can take:

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology file isn't too large or complex, you might be able to manually inspect it for classes or properties related to PhysicalSample or isRegistrantOf. This could involve searching for terms related to samples, registration, or any metadata descriptors that align with the GBO ontology descriptions.
Semantic Relationships: If there are known semantic relationships or patterns in how the ontologies are structured, identifying connections between PhysicalSample or isRegistrantOf and their equivalents in the GMO ontology could be guided by these patterns. For example, you might look for properties or classes that deal with samples, registration, or cataloging in the GMO ontology.
Consult Documentation or Community Resources: If the GMO ontology is part of a larger project or community effort, there might be documentation or forums where you can get insights into how it relates to concepts in the GBO ontology.
Ontology Editing Tools: Tools like Protégé or WebVOWL could be helpful for visually inspecting the GMO ontology and finding related concepts. These tools offer graphical representations of ontologies, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different entities.

To still provide you with helpful insight, let's discuss a general approach you could take to compare and find related parts between two ontologies, like GBO and GMO:

Identify Object Properties: You'd want to look for object properties in GMO that are analogous or have a similar role to main:originatesFrom in GBO. This involves comparing their domains and ranges to see if they align or overlap in any way.
Examine Class Hierarchies: Since main:PhysicalSample and main:Feature are mentioned as domain and range in GBO, identifying classes within GMO that serve similar purposes or are in some way related to these concepts would be crucial. This could involve looking at subclasses or superclasses of related concepts.
Domain and Range Compatibility: For any object property in GMO similar to main:originatesFrom, check if its domain and range are compatible or can be related to main:PhysicalSample, main:Feature, or their equivalents in GMO. This could include looking for properties that have a domain or range of a class that is equivalent to or a superclass/subclass of these GBO classes.
Semantic Similarity: Beyond structural similarity, considering the semantic context of the properties and classes might reveal connections not immediately obvious through structural analysis alone.
Without direct access to process the GMO ontology due to the encountered issue, these steps are a starting point for manually comparing the ontologies or attempting the comparison with different tools or methods.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as ""Age"" and ""Material Type"". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files.

To determine the most relevant modules in the GMO ontology that might be related to the GBO pieces you provided, we need to identify modules related to the concept of origins and inverse relationships, as highlighted by the isOriginOf and originatesFrom properties.

Given the list of modules in the GMO ontology, the most relevant modules that could help in finding pieces related to origins and inverse relationships are likely those dealing with entities and their relationships. Here are a few that seem most pertinent:

Agent: This module likely deals with entities that can act or be acted upon, which might include relationships of origin.
Event: Events often involve origins and outcomes, so this module might include relevant relationships.
Person: As a subset of Agent, this might detail origins of personal data or relationships.
Organization: Organizations often have origins and relationships that could be described.
Place: Places could have origins or relationships to other entities.
Physical Sample pattern: Physical samples might have origins or be sourced from specific locations or events.
Among these, the Agent module is the most generic and likely to include various types of entities and their relationships, making it the most relevant starting point for finding pieces related to isOriginOf and originatesFrom.

Would you like to explore the Agent module further, or do you need more detailed information about another specific module?","Given this below information about GMO,
 
The Agent pattern is a very simplistic pattern stub intended to model agents such as people or organiza- tion. Agents may perform a role (an instance of AgentRole class), e.g., in the context of events, organizations, etc. Alignments are specified with the Agent Role pattern (Chapter 2) depicted in Figure 1.2. 
ObjectProperty: performsAgentRole Class: AgentRole Class: Agent 

The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns. We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7). The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified. The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person. In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

 can you complete this rule gbo:isOriginOf (x , y ) ↔   gmo:?""""""","Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, we can complete the rule for gbo:isOriginOf(x, y) using the Agent and AgentRole classes in the GMO ontology. The isOriginOf relationship in GBO likely corresponds to a relationship where an agent performs a specific role that signifies an origin.

Given the structure provided, here is how we can map the GBO relationship to the GMO ontology:

GBO Triple: gbo:isOriginOf(x, y) means that x is the origin of y.
GMO Mapping:
x can be an instance of Agent (which could be a person or organization).
y can be an instance of AgentRole that the agent performs, indicating the context in which x is the origin of y.
Thus, the equivalent rule in the GMO ontology can be expressed as:
gbo:isOriginOf

It seems there was a misunderstanding on my end regarding accessing the content of the GMO ontology file. Instead of directly reading its content as I intended, let's approach this differently.

Given the structure of the GBO ontology you provided, specifically the concepts of PhysicalSample and originatesFrom, I can guide you on how to search for related parts in the GMO ontology based on common ontology design principles. Unfortunately, without direct access to the content, I can't provide specific matches or references within the GMO ontology. Here's a general strategy you can follow:

Search for Equivalent or Similar Classes: Look for classes in the GMO ontology that serve a similar purpose or have a similar definition to PhysicalSample. This might be classes related to biological or environmental samples, observations, or specimens.
Inspect Object Properties: Look for object properties in GMO that mirror the relationship described by originatesFrom in GBO. This involves properties that link samples to their origin, be it a geographical feature, a biological entity, or another sample. Pay special attention to the domain and range of these properties to ensure they align with those in GBO.
Look for Shared Vocabulary: Sometimes, ontologies covering similar domains might use shared or overlapping vocabularies. Check if the GMO ontology references IGSN (International Geo Sample Number) or similar standards. This could indicate areas of overlap.
Review Documentation and Metadata: If the GMO ontology includes comments or metadata similar to the description of PhysicalSample in GBO, it could help identify related parts. This information might be in the ontology headers, class annotations, or property descriptions.
Explore Hierarchies: Examine the class and property hierarchies within the GMO ontology for elements that are positioned similarly to PhysicalSample and originatesFrom within GBO. This can reveal structural similarities between the two ontologies.
To proceed effectively, you would need to use an ontology editor or viewer like Protégé, or perform text searches within the GMO ontology file for these key aspects.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

The Property Value pattern has been developed to model the properties of things. Currently, we differen- tiate the Property Value pattern from the Information Object pattern. Properties modeled by the Property Value pattern are those which are inherent to the target object, whereas the Information Object pattern captures additional information associated with the target thing. For example, age, shape, and material type should be modeled as the properties of a physical sample. On the contrary, name, description, and website should be considered as the information object for this physical sample. This distinction is derived from the philosophy literature (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/). 
A Property has a string to identify its name, such as """"Age"""" and """"Material Type"""". A Property has a value which can be a number, a string, a date, or some other value types. A PropertyUnit provides important metric information to interpret the value of the Property, and such metric units can be meter, kilometer, gram, and so forth. When the Property Value pattern is used to annotate data, we recommend to subclass the general class of Property with specific properties. For example, a data provider, who wants to publish some physical sample data, can first create a property called MaterialTypeProperty, and declare it as a subclass of Property. Then, he/she can populate the pattern with the actual material type values from data files. can you complete this rule gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ PhysicalSample(z) →   gmo:?""""""

Based on the given information, the rule you want to complete in the GMO ontology can be expressed by identifying the equivalent or related concepts in GMO ontology for PhysicalSample and originatesFrom.

Given that:

PhysicalSample in GBO is equivalent to ecglps:PhysicalSample in GMO.
originatesFrom in GBO is equivalent to ecglps:originatesFrom in GMO.
The rule can be completed as follows:

GBO Rule
gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ gbo:PhysicalSample(z)

Corresponding GMO Rule
ecglps:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ ecglps:originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ ecglps:PhysicalSample(z)

css
Copy code
gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ gbo:PhysicalSample(z) → gmo:originatesFrom(gmo:PhysicalSample)

Copy code
gmo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gmo:originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ gmo:PhysicalSample(z) → gmo:ecglps:originatesFrom(x, z)

SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)derivedUsing−.PhysicalSample A PhysicalSample is a subclass of a Feature which is a subclass of things.
PhysicalSample ⊑ Feature Feature ⊑ ⊤
When a Feature is the input feature of a SamplingProcess which derive another PhysicalSample, we say the PhysicalSample originates from the Feature.
derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom (16.9)
A PhysicalSample can have InformationObject which provides additional information about the PhysicalSample. Similarly, it can also have Property to describe some attributes, such as material type, color, age, and so forth.
