can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To help you find the related pieces in the gmo.ttl file based on the GBO ontology triples you provided, I'll need to examine the gmo.ttl file's contents. I'll look for elements that may correspond or relate to the hasDescription property defined in GBO, focusing on its type, domain, range, and label. Let me start by analyzing the gmo.ttl file.

The gmo.ttl file contains definitions and triples that are part of the GMO ontology, including standard prefixes for RDF, RDFS, OWL, XSD, and others, as well as a specific prefix for the GMO ontology itself (glpv: <http://gmo#>). To find pieces in GMO that relate to the GBO's hasDescription property, I'll search the file for properties that might serve a similar purpose or have similar characteristics (datatype, domain, range). This includes looking for properties that are used to describe things (possibly with a datatype of HTML or string), their labels, and how they are connected to other elements within the ontology. Let me proceed with this analysis. ​​

The analysis of the gmo.ttl file revealed several elements that may relate to the hasDescription property in your GBO ontology. Although the specific owl:DatatypeProperty named hasDescription was not directly found, there are various properties with rdfs:label annotations that indicate their purpose or description. These include:

describedBy
hasAttribute
hasDataSource
hasPersonName
hasPersonalInfoItem
hasPosition
hasPrimaryIdentifier
And several other properties focused on specific aspects or relationships within the ontology, each with a label that suggests its role or the information it conveys.

The presence of a property like describedBy or hasAttribute could serve similar purposes to hasDescription, depending on the domain and range specifics you're looking for. However, without exact matches to the criteria (datatype property, domain of owl:Thing, range including rdf:HTML or xsd:string), these are the closest related elements found based on the provided snippet of the gmo.ttl content.

If you need more detailed mapping or specific connections between these GMO elements and the GBO ontology, further analysis focusing on the exact domains, ranges, and usages of these properties would be necessary.","User

Given this detailed description, here's a more focused approach on what to look for in the GMO ontology:

Classes Comparable to Information Object and Realizations:
Search for a class or concept in GMO that serves as an equivalent to InformationObject, which might be any entity capable of describing other entities through various properties (like hasDescription).
Look for classes that might represent InformationRealization, indicating entities that are concrete realizations or manifestations of information (e.g., digital files, documents).
Object Properties for Descriptive Relationships:
Identify object properties similar to isDescribedBy and isRealizedBy that link entities to their descriptions or realizations.
Properties akin to hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier would indicate mechanisms for uniquely identifying entities within the ontology.
Data Properties for Descriptions and Identifiers:
Data properties equivalent to hasDescription, hasWebpage, alsoKnownAs, seeAlso, and hasCanonicalName, which are used to provide descriptive text, URLs, alternative names, and canonical names for instances.
Given these specific aspects to look for, I will attempt another analysis of the GMO ontology, focusing on identifying classes, object properties, and data properties that align with the Information Object pattern's components as you've outlined. Let's proceed with this adjusted focus.
Error analyzing
Despite my efforts, I've encountered another technical hurdle that prevents me from directly querying the GMO ontology for elements related to the Information Object pattern you've described. This limitation hampers the ability to pinpoint classes, object properties, and data properties that align with those in the GBO ontology based on the description and structure you've provided.

Given this challenge, I recommend a manual approach or utilizing a local RDF/ontology editor and SPARQL endpoint to explore the GMO ontology. Here are some specific steps you can take to find the relevant parts:

Search for Classes: Look for classes in the GMO ontology that resemble InformationObject, InformationRealization, and Identifier. These may not have the exact names but serve similar conceptual roles.
Identify Object and Data Properties: Focus on finding properties that link information objects to the entities they describe (akin to isDescribedBy) or detail their realization (similar to isRealizedBy). Additionally, seek out data properties that provide descriptive metadata, such as names, descriptions, and identifiers.
Utilize SPARQL Queries: Construct and run SPARQL queries against the GMO ontology to find elements that match the criteria for the Information Object pattern.

The GBO ontology snippet centers on a hasTitle property, which is an owl:DatatypeProperty with a range of xsd:string, and it applies to a broad range of classes like Award, Cruise, Dataset, etc. This property is intended to provide a title or name for instances of these classes.

Given the information about the GMO's Information Object pattern, here's how the two might relate or complement each other:

Information Object and Digital Object: In the GMO ontology, the Information Object can describe any entity, and it includes properties like hasDescription, hasWebpage, and seeAlso, which align with the purpose of providing additional, descriptive information about an entity. The Digital Object, being a subclass of InformationRealization, seems to be specifically designed to represent digital artifacts (e.g., csv files, word documents) associated with an entity.
Properties for Descriptive Information: In the GMO, properties like hasDescription, hasWebpage, seeAlso, hasCanonicalName, and alsoKnownAs serve a similar role to hasTitle in the GBO, in that they provide human-readable information about entities. The hasTitle property from GBO could be seen as a specific instance or parallel of such descriptive properties, focusing on the name or title of the object.
Unique Identifiers: The GMO ontology's properties hasPrimaryIdentifier and hasAlternativeIdentifier offer a system for uniquely identifying objects, which could complement the information provided by hasTitle in GBO by offering a mechanism for identification beyond human-readable names.
Classes: The classes mentioned (InformationObject, Identifier, InformationRealization) provide a structured way to represent information about entities, which could be linked to the various classes mentioned in your GBO snippet (e.g., Award, Cruise) through properties like isDescribedBy or isRealizedBy.
Given these observations, the pieces in GMO related to the GBO parts might include:

The InformationObject class and its related properties for describing and linking to digital or physical entities.
The properties for description and identification, which can offer detailed, structured information about entities akin to how hasTitle provides a title for an entity in GBO.
The concept of DigitalObject as a specific case of information realization that could relate to any digital representations or components mentioned in GBO.
These parallels suggest a framework within GMO for providing detailed, structured descriptions and identifications of entities, similar to but broader than the specific use case of hasTitle in GBO.",FALSE,3/3,1,2/5,0.6,,,2/5,0.6,,Recall_median,0.75,Precision_median,0.5

This Information Object pattern seems to emphasize the use of metadata to describe various objects, similar to the notion in DOLCE and aligning with standards like W3C's Prov-O. The goal is to provide a structured way to associate additional information (like descriptions, webpages, identifiers, etc.) with any entity.

Considering this conceptual framework, when looking for related pieces in the GMO ontology to the GBO ontology's hasAbstract property and associated classes (Award, Cruise, Dataset, Document, Program), we should focus on:

Properties and classes that are intended to describe or provide metadata about entities.
The use of a single information object to encapsulate this descriptive information.
Properties that align with the mentioned attributes (description, webpage URLs, canonical names, identifiers).
Without directly accessing the content of the GMO file again due to the previous issue, we can infer that relevant pieces in the GMO ontology would likely include:

A Datatype Property Similar to ""hasAbstract"": Look for properties intended to provide textual descriptions of entities. This could be a direct match or a similar property with a purpose of describing entities, possibly named along the lines of hasDescription or description.
Classes Related to Metadata or Information Objects: Since the Information Object pattern describes entities with additional information, search for classes in GMO that serve as metadata holders or information encapsulators. This might not directly match the classes named in GBO (Award, Cruise, Dataset, Document, Program) but rather look for any superclass or equivalent that serves as a generic holder of information about various entities.
Properties for URLs and Identifiers: Properties in GMO that provide URL information (hasWebpage, seeAlso) and identifiers (hasPrimaryIdentifier, hasAlternativeIdentifier) would be closely aligned with the GBO's approach to entity description.
Digital Object and Information Realization: If the GMO ontology includes concepts related to digital objects or information realization, these would be directly related, especially if there's mention of subclassing or alignment with the described pattern.
To accurately identify these pieces in the GMO ontology, one would typically query the ontology file using tools like Protégé with SPARQL queries, or process the file programmatically, as attempted earlier.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To assist you accurately, I'll need to examine the contents of the gmo.ttl file you uploaded to understand its structure and find elements related to the Identifier class and its associated properties (hasIdentifier, hasIdentifierScheme, and hasIdentifierValue) as described in the GBO ontology.

I'll start by analyzing the gmo.ttl file to identify any classes, properties, or instances that match or relate to the ones from GBO you've mentioned. Let's begin with reading the file and looking for relevant pieces.

The gmo.ttl file starts with a series of namespace prefixes that are common in RDF and OWL ontologies, indicating that it is structured in a similar way to your GBO ontology snippet. It includes prefixes for RDF, RDFS, OWL, and others, alongside a specific prefix for what appears to be the GMO ontology itself (http://gmo).

To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the Identifier class and its associated properties (hasIdentifier, hasIdentifierScheme, hasIdentifierValue) from GBO, I will now search for these terms or related concepts within the content of the gmo.ttl file. This involves looking for classes, properties, comments, labels, or seeAlso references that match or are similar to the GBO ontology components you've described. ​​

In the gmo.ttl ontology, there are several parts related to identifiers and their schemes and values, similar to what you described in the GBO ontology. Here are the findings:

hasAlternativeIdentifier: An object property that might be used to capture alternative identifiers for entities.
hasPrimaryIdentifier: Another object property, possibly used to denote the primary identifier for entities.
hasIdentifierScheme: A datatype property that specifies the scheme of an identifier, similar to the hasIdentifierScheme in GBO.
hasIdentifierValue: While the snippet does not show the details, it's likely a property that captures the value of an identifier, akin to the hasIdentifierValue in GBO.
These elements indicate that while the GMO ontology uses slightly different terminology or categorizations for identifiers (e.g., distinguishing between primary and alternative identifiers), it shares the concept of identifying entities through schemes and values, as seen in GBO.

This analysis suggests a thematic overlap between the two ontologies concerning how identifiers are represented and managed, although the exact structure and naming conventions may vary. ​","you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info that can help: The Identifier pattern, as depicted in Figure 5.1, captures arbitrary identifiers that a data provider may use on their data. This is especially useful for non-URI identifiers such as local catalogue numbers, etc. We expect identifier information to be used in conjunction with the Information Object pattern (Chapter 5, although we do not axiomatize it here. We model an identifier to have exactly one string literal as its value, and at most one identifier scheme. The scheme can either be a string literal or a URI.

Error analyzing
It seems we've encountered a persistent technical difficulty in executing specific queries against the GMO ontology based on the detailed criteria you provided related to the Identifier pattern and associated elements. This limitation prevents me from directly extracting and presenting the exact matches or related entities within the GMO ontology based on the additional context you've shared.

Given this, I recommend using ontology management tools or software that supports SPARQL queries for in-depth analysis and exploration of your ontologies. Tools like Protégé, OntoText GraphDB, or Apache Jena Fuseki can provide the environment needed to manually execute these types of queries. They can help you identify and explore the relationships, classes, and properties you're interested in, based on the patterns and constraints you've outlined.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts specified in the GBO ontology snippet you provided, I'll first need to examine the content of the gmo.ttl file you uploaded. Specifically, I'll look for any components (classes, properties, or instances) that might correspond or be conceptually linked to the hasIdentifierValue property in GBO. This includes looking for properties with similar purposes (dealing with identifiers or their values), domains (related to Identifier or equivalent entities), and ranges (possibly xsd:string or similar).

Let's start by examining the gmo.ttl file to identify any relevant components.
The gmo.ttl file starts with a series of prefix declarations, indicating it defines or references entities within the GMO ontology using namespaces such as dc, owl, rdf, xsd, rdfs, skos, terms, and a specific prefix for GMO (glpv). To find pieces in GMO related to the hasIdentifierValue property from GBO, I'll search the file for definitions or usage of datatype properties, their domains and ranges, particularly focusing on properties related to identifiers or strings, and comments or labels that might indicate a connection to the concept of identifier values.

Let's proceed to search the gmo.ttl contents for relevant matches. ​​
After searching through the gmo.ttl file, I did not find any properties directly matching the criteria related to hasIdentifierValue from the GBO ontology, based on the specified domains (related to Identifier), ranges (xsd:string), or concepts related to identifier values within the given constraints of our search.

This could mean there are no directly comparable properties within the gmo.ttl content, at least not with the specific search parameters used. It's possible that the relevant properties in GMO might be defined with slightly different terminology, or the ontology structure might not emphasize identifiers in the same way.

If you have specific aspects of the hasIdentifierValue property you're most interested in (like its role in linking identifiers to their string values, or its use within a particular context), I could refine the search or analyze the ontology differently.

Given the specific details and patterns mentioned, let's try to outline an approach to identify related components in the GMO ontology without direct access to the content of the ontology file.

Identify Identifier-Related Classes and Properties: Look for classes named Identifier, InformationObject, and InformationRealization or similar, as these are directly mentioned as part of the identifier pattern. Properties such as hasIdentifierValue, hasIdentifierScheme, and any object properties like isDescribedBy, isRealizedBy, hasPrimaryIdentifier, hasAlternativeIdentifier, would also be relevant.
Data and Object Properties: Focus on finding data properties in the GMO ontology that serve the function of linking an identifier to its value (hasIdentifierValue) or scheme (hasIdentifierScheme). Object properties that link information objects and their identifiers or realizations (e.g., isDescribedBy, isRealizedBy) are also crucial.
Cardinality and Type Restrictions: Look for any restrictions that specify an identifier must have exactly one string literal as its value and at most one identifier scheme, which could be indicated by cardinality constraints or type restrictions in the ontology.
Use of xsd:string and xsd:anyURI: Since the identifier pattern specifies the use of xsd:string and xsd:anyURI, searching for properties or classes that explicitly mention these types could help pinpoint relevant parts of the GMO ontology.
Auxiliary Properties: Besides the core identifier properties, auxiliary properties like hasWebpage, alsoKnownAs, hasDescription, seeAlso, and hasCanonicalName are related to how information objects or identifiers might be further described or linked, providing additional context or alternative identifiers.
Since direct inspection and querying of the GMO ontology file encountered issues, the outlined approach is a conceptual guide based on the patterns and structures you've described. If you have tools like Protégé at your disposal, you could use them to manually search for these elements within the GMO ontology. Alternatively, if there's a specific query or a more detailed description of what you're looking for within those patterns, I could offer further advice or suggest RDF/SPARQL queries that might help you extract this information directly if you're able to query the ontology in an environment that supports it.",FALSE,1/1,1,5/6,0.1666666667,,,5/6,0.1666666667,,,,,

Without direct access to the GMO ontology content due to the technical issues encountered, I'll provide a general approach on how to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on these ","Given the detailed description of the identifier pattern and related elements you've provided from another part of your ontologies, you can approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology by focusing on several key areas:

Object Properties
Look for object properties similar to isDescribedBy, isRealizedBy, hasPrimaryIdentifier, and hasAlternativeIdentifier. These properties indicate relationships between entities and their identifiers or metadata, closely aligning with the purpose of capturing arbitrary identifiers.
Data Properties
Search for data properties like hasWebpage, alsoKnownAs, hasDescription, seeAlso, and hasCanonicalName. These properties are essential for linking entities to additional information, alternative names, or descriptions, which are common aspects of managing identifiers and metadata.
Classes
Identify classes such as InformationObject, Identifier, and InformationRealization. These are directly involved in the management and representation of identifiers and their associated data or contexts.
Specific Modeling Constraints
Check for modeling constraints related to identifiers. This includes constraints that ensure an identifier has exactly one string literal value and at most one identifier scheme. Look for usage of properties like hasIdentifierValue and hasIdentifierScheme, along with their specified cardinality constraints and data types (xsd:string and xsd:anyURI).
General Approach
Use Ontology Editing and Querying Tools: Tools like Protégé are particularly helpful for navigating and querying ontologies. You can use SPARQL queries to search for classes, properties, and constraints that match the patterns described.

Search for Keywords and Patterns: In your ontology editor or a text editor, search for keywords such as the names of specific object properties, data properties, and classes related to the identifier pattern. Also, look for the specific modeling constraints syntax if the tool or format supports it.

Review Documentation and Comments: Annotations, comments, and documentation within the ontology can provide insights into the intended use of specific properties or classes and any constraints or modeling decisions that have been applied.

Examine Class Hierarchies and Property Graphs: Understanding the structure of your ontology, including class hierarchies and the relationships between properties, can help identify related concepts even if they are not directly named after the patterns you are looking for.

Since direct analysis of the GMO ontology file isn't possible here, this approach provides a structured way to manually explore and find related pieces in your ontology.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","In broadening the search to include concepts related to identifiers within the GMO ontology, several relevant predicates and objects were identified. These elements could potentially relate to or be analogous to the main:isIdentifierOf property in your GBO ontology:

Predicates and Concepts:
http://gmo#hasIdentifierValue: Provides the value of the identifier (of type xsd:string or xsd:anyURI).
http://gmo#hasAlternativeIdentifier: Represents alternative identifiers for an entity.
http://gmo#hasIdentifierScheme: Provides the scheme of the identifier (as a string or URI), e.g., DOI, ORCID, etc.
http://gmo#hasPrimaryIdentifier: Indicates the primary identifier for an entity.
http://gmo#Identifier: Represents identifiers, each having exactly one identifier value and may have an identifier scheme.
Related Objects and Descriptions:
Literals related to identifiers, including descriptions about how an identifier scheme or value is represented in the GMO ontology.
These elements suggest that the GMO ontology includes detailed handling of identifiers, distinguishing between primary and alternative identifiers, as well as specifying identifier schemes and values. This nuanced approach to identifiers in GMO might correlate with or complement the isIdentifierOf concept in your GBO ontology, providing a framework for linking identifiers to their respective entities.

Depending on your specific use case, these identified predicates and concepts from the GMO ontology could be aligned, mapped, or integrated with the main:isIdentifierOf property from the GBO ontology to achieve interoperability or to enrich the semantic understanding across both ontologies. ​​","""Given the additional information you've provided about the Identifier pattern and related concepts from another part of your ontologies, we can outline what we're looking for in the GMO ontology to find related pieces:

Based on the detailed outline you provided about the Identifier pattern and related concepts, here’s how you can approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology, even without direct access to its content at this moment:

Related Object Properties Search:

isDescribedBy, isRealizedBy, hasPrimaryIdentifier, hasAlternativeIdentifier:
Look for object properties in the GMO ontology that link identifiers to the entities they identify or describe. These relationships might be used to connect physical samples, database entries, or conceptual entities with their identifiers.
Related Data Properties Search:

hasWebpage, alsoKnownAs, hasDescription, seeAlso, hasCanonicalName:
Search for data properties that provide additional descriptive information about entities, including their web presence, alternative names, detailed descriptions, references to further information, or canonical names. These are likely to be used in conjunction with identifiers to enrich the information about the identified entity.
Related Classes Search:

InformationObject, Identifier, InformationRealization:
Focus on finding these classes or similar concepts within the GMO ontology. InformationObject might be a broad category encompassing various types of data items. Identifier would be a class specifically for entities that serve as identifiers. InformationRealization could refer to the manifestation or implementation of information in a specific form.
Specific Modeling Constraints:

The constraints on the Identifier class regarding hasIdentifierValue and hasIdentifierScheme suggest you should look for the specific modeling of identifiers within GMO. This involves identifying how identifiers are represented (e.g., as strings or URIs) and any restrictions on their format or scheme.
Practical Steps for Searching:

Use SPARQL queries or ontology browsing tools to search for the mentioned patterns. For example, a SPARQL query can help find all object and data properties related to identifiers by looking for properties whose names or descriptions match the patterns you’re interested in.

The key elements from GMO related to the GBO Place class seem to be around modeling places with non-geospatial and geospatial characteristics.

Here's how the elements in GMO relate to the Place class in GBO based on your description:

Class ecglpl:Place and Place in GBO: Even though the exact Place class is not explicitly mentioned in your GMO details, the description implies a concept of places that could be semantically similar to the Place class in GBO. In both ontologies, a place is considered to have spatial extent and can be associated with various information.
Class ecglpl:InformationObject and ecglio:InformationObject: These are intended to describe non-geospatial information related to places, such as names or web pages. This could correlate with the GBO Place class's idea that a place can be described by various information, possibly including non-geospatial information.
Object Properties ecglpl:isDescribedBy and ecglio:isDescribedBy: These properties suggest a mechanism for linking places to their descriptive information objects. In GBO, if there's any mechanism or property for linking Place to its descriptions, these GMO properties could serve a similar purpose.
Class ecglpl:Geometry and geosparql:Geometry: Although detailed specifications are omitted, the mention of Geometry and its alignment with the GeoSPARQL standard indicates that places in GMO are intended to have spatial footprints defined in geospatial terms. This aligns with the GBO Place class's notion of having a spatial extent, suggesting that geometrical descriptions might be a common ground between the two ontologies.
Given these insights, the related pieces in GMO to GBO's Place could potentially include:

The concept of places (ecglpl:Place if present or similar).
Information objects (ecglpl:InformationObject, ecglio:InformationObject) that describe places.
The object properties (ecglpl:isDescribedBy, ecglio:isDescribedBy) linking places to their descriptions.
The concept of geometry for defining spatial footprints (ecglpl:Geometry, geosparql:Geometry).

Let's try a different approach to answer your question without directly parsing the file. Instead, I'll use my understanding of ontologies and their common structures to infer possible relations between the GBO and GMO ontologies, based on the provided GBO triples.

The GBO ontology defines a class PlaceType with a comment indicating it's a descriptor for types of places, such as oceans, shorelines, islands, etc. To find related parts in the GMO ontology, we can look for:

Equivalent or Similar Classes: Classes in GMO that represent geographical locations or types of places could be directly related to PlaceType in GBO. This might include classes for specific types of geographical features.
Properties related to Place Types: Properties in GMO that link individuals or other classes to their geographical types or locations could be related. This includes properties that denote a specific feature of a location, such as ""hasLocationType"" or ""isLocatedIn"".
Instances of related Classes: Specific instances (individuals) in GMO that are categorized under classes similar to PlaceType. For example, instances representing specific oceans, islands, or other geographical features.
Since I encountered an error trying to directly access the GMO ontology file, these suggestions are based on typical ontology design practices and may help guide you to manually find related parts in the GMO ontology based on the structure and content of the GBO ontology.

Given this situation, I can offer some general advice on how you might find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the GBO ontology triples you mentioned. If you're looking for relationships similar to hasPlaceType, isPlaceTypeOf, and their domains and ranges (Place and PlaceType), you could:

Search for Object Properties with Similar Relationships: Look for object properties in the GMO that have similar inverse relationships, or that connect entities in a way analogous to how places are related to place types in GBO.
Identify Similar Domain and Range Classes: Look for classes in the GMO that could serve as analogs for Place and PlaceType. These could be directly named or serve similar conceptual roles.
Examine Labels and Comments: Sometimes, ontologies include human-readable labels (with rdfs:label) or comments (with rdfs:comment) that can provide hints about the roles of different classes and properties, making it easier to identify related components.
Manual Inspection or Querying: Depending on the size of the GMO ontology and the tools at your disposal, you might manually inspect the ontology for related constructs or use a query language like SPARQL to programmatically search for related elements based on the structure and relationships you're interested in.

Spatial Footprint, representing a geometric feature in space, aligning with the GeoSPARQL standard.
Given these insights, let's draw parallels to the GBO ontology components you've shared:

Object Properties: In GMO, ecglpl:isDescribedBy and ecglio:isDescribedBy are analogous to hasPlaceType in GBO, focusing on the relationship between a place and its descriptive information rather than a place type. However, they signify the association between a place and its information object, which could be seen as a similar way of providing additional details or categorization, albeit through different means.
Classes: ecglpl:InformationObject and ecglio:InformationObject in GMO serve a similar conceptual role to PlaceType in GBO, in that they categorize or provide specific information about places. The difference here is that while GBO's PlaceType might categorize places into types or roles, GMO's InformationObjects attach descriptive information to places.
Spatial Representation: The mention of Geometry classes aligned with the GeoSPARQL standard suggests a focus on the spatial aspects of places, which might not have a direct counterpart in the GBO triples you provided but is crucial for understanding the geospatial component of places in GMO.
Prefixes and Ontology Organization: The use of specific prefixes (ecglpl, ecglio, and geosparql) indicates how GMO structures its information and relates to external standards like GeoSPARQL, which might be useful for linking GBO's place-related concepts with GMO's approach to describing places and their spatial characteristics.
In summary, while there isn't a direct one-to-one mapping between the specific triples in GBO and the described components of GMO, the latter's focus on describing places through information objects and spatial footprints offers a parallel in terms of how places are represented and categorized, albeit with a distinct approach focusing on descriptive information and geospatial features. The integration of these concepts from GMO into GBO, or vice versa, would depend on the specific objectives of the ontology development, such as whether the emphasis is on the type of place, the descriptive information about the place, or the place's spatial characteristics.",TRUE,0,inf,2/2,0,Type(),,2/2,0,,,,,

The ontology aims to model places as entities described by information objects, which can include non-geospatial information (like names and web pages) as well as spatial footprints (geometric features such as points, lines, polygons), intending to align with the GeoSPARQL standard in the future.

Given this context, and comparing it with the isPlaceTypeOf property from the GBO ontology, the following pieces from the GMO ontology seem related or could be leveraged in association with isPlaceTypeOf:

Object Properties:
ecglpl:isDescribedBy and ecglio:isDescribedBy properties might relate to how places (which could be types in the context of isPlaceTypeOf) are described by information objects. This linkage is relevant because isPlaceTypeOf could imply a relationship where a place is categorized under a specific type, and these properties detail how those places are described.
Classes:
ecglpl:InformationObject and ecglio:InformationObject are classes that represent information objects in the GMO ontology. Given that isPlaceTypeOf suggests a relation where one entity (likely a place) is classified under a type, these classes could be useful to represent or attach detailed information to such places.
ecglpl:Geometry and geosparql:Geometry are mentioned as classes intended to represent geometric features of places. Although the detailed specification of Geometry is planned for future work, these could conceptually relate to the spatial aspect of the places being categorized by isPlaceTypeOf, especially in terms of their spatial footprint.
Alignment with GeoSPARQL:
The intention to align Geometry with the GeoSPARQL standard indicates a future direction towards integrating geospatial querying capabilities, which could enhance the modeling and querying of spatial relationships like those implied by isPlaceTypeOf.
Considering isPlaceTypeOf(x,y) as a property expressing a relationship where x is a type of place and y is a specific instance of a place, the relevant parts in GMO would include the mechanism to describe places (ecglpl:isDescribedBy), the information objects related to these places (ecglpl:InformationObject), and the anticipated integration with geometric features (ecglpl:Geometry).

Let's break down the information to see how it can guide us in understanding the mapping and relationships in GMO:

GeoFeature Mapping: The query gbo:GeoFeature(x) → gmo:? suggests we're looking for the counterpart of gbo:GeoFeature in the GMO ontology. The description hints at geospatial features and places of interest (POIs) associated with certain geospatial features.

Place and Information Object Relationship: The ontology aims to describe places of interest by associating them with information objects. This approach allows attaching non-geospatial information (e.g., names, web pages) to places, in addition to their spatial footprint (geometric features like points, lines, polygons).

Integration with GeoSPARQL: The mention of Geometry alignment with the GeoSPARQL standard indicates an intention to use or extend GeoSPARQL geometries within the GMO ontology. GeoSPARQL provides a standard way to represent and query geospatial data on the Semantic Web.

Ontology Prefixes and Classes: The prefixes ecglpl and ecglio reference specific parts of the ontology related to places and information objects, respectively. The object properties isDescribedBy and the class InformationObject along with their subclasses and subproperties show an established hierarchy and relationship pattern intended for modeling places and their descriptions.

Given these insights, in GMO, we should look for:

Classes or concepts that represent geospatial features and places of interest, potentially aligned with or extending GeoSPARQL geometries.
The use of information objects to describe these places, indicating a structure where places are associated with non-geospatial attributes through information objects.
Object properties similar to isDescribedBy, which link places to their descriptions or information objects.
Possible alignments or equivalences to GeoSPARQL's Geometry class to handle the spatial aspects of places.
Unfortunately, due to the technical issues encountered earlier, I'm unable to directly query the GMO ontology file to extract exact matches or related constructs. However, the guidance above should help you manually explore the GMO ontology with tools like Protégé to identify the relevant classes, properties, and patterns that correspond to the concepts and intentions outlined in the additional information you provided.

GeoFeatureType in GBO: This appears to represent a specific class of geographical features or spatial entities, possibly aligning with real-world places or geospatial geometries. It's a subclass of both FeatureType and PlaceType, indicating it incorporates aspects of both these categories.
Place and Geometry in GMO: The GMO ontology mentions a ""Place"" pattern intended to describe points of interest (POIs) with geospatial features. Although it's stated that the detailed specification of Geometry is omitted for now, the intention to align it with the GeoSPARQL standard suggests a focus on geospatial representation. The classes and properties provided (ecglpl:InformationObject, ecglio:InformationObject, ecglpl:isDescribedBy, ecglio:isDescribedBy) indicate that places in GMO are linked to information objects, which can contain non-geospatial information but also have a spatial footprint represented by some form of geometry (point, line, polygon, etc.).
Based on this information, the correlation to GeoFeatureType in GBO would likely be through the concepts of Place and Geometry in GMO:

Place in GMO could relate to the GeoFeatureType in GBO as both describe entities associated with geospatial features or locations. The emphasis on places being described by information objects in GMO aligns with the notion of GeoFeatureType being a type of spatial feature described in the GBO ontology.
Geometry in GMO and its intended alignment with the GeoSPARQL standard could directly relate to the spatial aspects of GeoFeatureType in GBO. Although GMO's current version may not fully specify Geometry, the reference to geometric features in space (points, lines, polygons) is conceptually similar to what might be encompassed by GeoFeatureType.
Therefore, if we're mapping GeoFeatureType from GBO to concepts in GMO, the closest matches would be the overall ""Place"" pattern (particularly the use of information objects to describe places with geospatial features) and the notion of ""Geometry"" as it relates to spatial representation, even though the latter is not fully fleshed out in the current version of GMO.",FALSE,1/2,0.5,2/3,0.3333333333,lack of class-related info in module,,2/3,0.3333333333,,,,,

Identifying Key Concepts and Properties: Start with the main concepts and properties you're interested in from the GBO ontology, such as GeoFeature, GeoFeatureType, hasGeoFeatureType, etc.
Searching for Similarities: Use an RDF or ontology editor to search the GMO ontology for similar or related concepts and properties. Look for properties with similar roles (like object properties connecting features to their types), and classes related to geographical or spatial entities.
Comparing Structure and Semantics: Compare the structure (how concepts are connected) and semantics (meaning of concepts and properties) of related findings in GMO to those in GBO. This can help identify equivalences or differences that may not be immediately apparent from names alone.
Utilizing Ontology Tools: Tools like Protégé or RDFlib in Python can be helpful for querying and exploring ontologies. SPARQL queries can specifically target the aspects you're interested in, such as properties with certain domains or ranges.
Consulting Ontology Documentation: If available, documentation for the GMO ontology might provide insights into its structure and how it might map to or differ from the GBO ontology.

Places being associated with geospatial features.
Information Objects being used to describe non-geospatial information about places, such as names or web pages.
Spatial Footprints, representing geometric features in space (points, lines, polygons), though detailed specifications of geometry are planned for future work and are intended to align with the GeoSPARQL standard.
Given this context and the specific mention of the ecglpl:isDescribedBy object property, the ecglpl:InformationObject and ecglpl:Geometry classes, as well as their relationships with their counterparts under the ecglio and geosparql prefixes, we can start drawing parallels between the GBO and GMO ontologies:

GeoFeatureType in GBO could relate to the concept of Geometry in GMO since both are concerned with the categorization or typing of geospatial features. In GMO, Geometry is intended to describe spatial footprints, which aligns with the role of GeoFeatureType in GBO as a classification for geospatial features.
GeoFeature in GBO seems to correspond to Places in GMO. Both concepts serve as the primary entities of interest within their respective ontologies, associated with geospatial characteristics. In GMO, a place is described as having a spatial footprint (Geometry), which could be analogous to a GeoFeature in GBO having a specific GeoFeatureType.
The object property isDescribedBy in both ecglpl and ecglio namespaces in GMO could find a parallel in GBO's approach to associating features with their descriptive information. This property signifies the linkage between a place or an information object and its description, which could be similar to how GeoFeatures might be linked to their types or descriptive attributes in GBO.
Information Object concepts across both GMO and GBO potentially overlap in their function of attaching non-geospatial information to geospatial entities. The dual presence in both ecglpl and ecglio namespaces suggests a shared or inherited concept, possibly akin to how a GeoFeatureType might include descriptive non-geospatial information about a GeoFeature in GBO.
Given these considerations, when mapping from GBO to GMO, one might look at how GeoFeatureTypes (as classifications or categories of GeoFeatures) could align with the GMO concepts of Geometry (as types of spatial footprints) and how the broader categorization and description mechanisms (such as isDescribedBy) operate within the GMO framework.

It seems I'm currently facing a technical issue accessing the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. While I can't directly read the file content due to this hiccup, I can still provide guidance on how you might find related pieces between the GMO and GBO ontologies based on typical ontology and RDF structure.

In RDF and ontology work, finding related parts usually involves looking for shared concepts, properties, or classes that either directly match or conceptually align between the two ontologies. Given the GBO ontology's mention of an object property isGeoFeatureTypeOf, you'd want to look for similar object properties, classes, or instances in the GMO ontology that deal with geographical features or their classifications.

Here are a few steps you can take to manually find related pieces:

Search for Similar Properties: Look for properties in GMO that have a similar name or description to isGeoFeatureTypeOf. Properties that handle relationships or classifications of geographical features would be of particular interest.
Check for Shared Classes: If GBO's isGeoFeatureTypeOf links certain types of geographical features, see if GMO has equivalent or related classes that represent geographical entities.
Review Domain and Range: For any property similar to isGeoFeatureTypeOf in GMO, check its domain and range. This can help you understand what types of entities the property connects, offering clues to its relationship with GBO's concepts.
Examine Ontology Metadata: Sometimes, ontologies include metadata or comments that mention their relation to other ontologies or the scope of their application. This could provide hints about connections between GMO and GBO.
Use Ontology Alignment Tools: There are tools and frameworks designed for aligning and comparing ontologies. These can automate the search for related concepts and properties by analyzing the structure and semantics of the ontologies.

Geospatial Features and Geometry Alignment: The concept of geospatial features in GBO, as denoted by isGeoFeatureTypeOf, seems to align with the GMO's emphasis on places having a spatial footprint represented as geometric features (e.g., points, lines, polygons). This suggests a connection to the ecglpl:Geometry and geosparql:Geometry classes in GMO, which are intended to represent geometric features in space, aligning with the GeoSPARQL standard.

Information Object Descriptions: The information associated with geospatial features in GBO could relate to the way places are described by information objects in GMO. Both the ecglpl:isDescribedBy and ecglio:isDescribedBy object properties in GMO facilitate the attachment of non-geospatial information (like names or web pages) to places, which could be analogous to how geospatial features are identified or described in GBO.

Given these points, the GBO isGeoFeatureTypeOf relationship could potentially map to several concepts in GMO, including:

The relationship between places and their geometric representations (ecglpl:Geometry or geosparql:Geometry).
The descriptive linkage between places and their associated information (ecglpl:isDescribedBy or ecglio:isDescribedBy).
To establish a precise mapping or equivalence between isGeoFeatureTypeOf in GBO and the relevant properties or classes in GMO, one might consider the following RDF statements or ontology design patterns:

Equivalence or subproperty assertions between isGeoFeatureTypeOf and GMO's properties for linking places to their geometric features or information descriptions. For instance, if isGeoFeatureTypeOf is primarily about linking geospatial features to their types or categories, it might be closely related to how ecglpl:Geometry is used in GMO to specify the type of geometric representation a place has.

Defining new properties or classes in GMO that explicitly align with the geospatial categorization intent of isGeoFeatureTypeOf in GBO, ensuring clear semantics for cross-ontology interoperability.

Without direct access to the full details of both ontologies and their intended use cases, this interpretation aims to provide a conceptual bridge based on the provided descriptions.

Let me start by examining the GMO ontology file to identify related components.
It appears that the initial inspection did not yield direct results or there might have been a misunderstanding in the way the data was queried. This suggests that there might not be direct annotations like comments and labels for all classes, or the specific terms related to ""Award"" as described in the GBO ontology snippet might not be directly present or labeled in a straightforward manner in the GMO ontology.

Given this outcome, there are a few approaches we could take:

Broaden the Search Criteria: Instead of looking only for direct class annotations like comments and labels, we could search more broadly for any references to key concepts related to ""Award"", such as funding, organizations, and participation, across all types of RDF statements in the ontology.
Search for Specific Relations: We could try to identify specific properties or relationships within the GMO ontology that could logically correspond to the concept of an award, funding, or organizational support.
Manual Inspection: Given the complexity and specificity of ontology matching, it might also be beneficial to manually inspect the GMO ontology file for elements that relate to the concept of an award, if the ontology is not too large or complex.
Let's proceed with a broader search for related concepts within the ontology, focusing on any references that might correspond to the concept of an ""Award"" as it's described in the GBO ontology. This includes looking for terms related to funding, organizations, and participation. ​​
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue with processing the RDF data, specifically when trying to compute qualified names (QNames) for some of the URIs. This error might be due to encountering blank nodes or literals in positions where a QName was expected, which can happen in RDF data structures.

Given this challenge, a direct automated search for related components within the GMO ontology based on specific keywords related to ""Award"" seems to be complex due to the structure of the ontology and the processing constraints.

As direct automated extraction has proven challenging, there are a few alternative approaches we might consider:

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology is not too large, manual inspection might be feasible to identify related concepts. This would involve looking through the ontology file for mentions of relevant terms and concepts manually.
Structured Query: Using more structured query approaches such as SPARQL to query the ontology might yield better results. SPARQL allows for more complex queries, including searching for patterns and relationships that might not be directly labeled with specific keywords.
Semantic Analysis: More advanced semantic analysis or ontology matching techniques could be applied if you have specific requirements or a larger project in mind. This could involve software tools designed for ontology alignment and mapping.

It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern.
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc.                                                                                                                          Prefix: : <http://schema.geolink.org/dev/fundingaward#> Prefix: xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

","With the additional information you've provided about the Funding Award pattern and its related concepts, it's clearer now what to look for in the GMO ontology. The detailed description of properties, classes, and their relationships provides a solid basis for identifying relevant parts within the GMO ontology. Specifically, we're interested in finding components that align with concepts such as funding awards, the isFundedBy property, agent roles, and the relationships between these entities.

Given the structure of ontologies and the way RDF data is modeled, we can now target our search more precisely. We should look for:

ObjectProperties that resemble or align with isFundedBy, startsOnDate, endsOnDate, isDescribedBy, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, hasAwardAmount, and hasCurrencyCode.
Classes that could represent or relate to FundingAward, Agent, TimeInstant, AgentRole (including specific roles like SponsorRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole), InformationObject, AwardAmount, and CurrencyCode.
DataProperties related to hasCurrencyValue and potentially others that capture the specifics of funding awards, such as amount and currency code.
With this refined scope, I'll now perform a targeted search within the GMO ontology for these components or their equivalents, focusing on object properties, classes, and data properties that align with the concepts described. Let's proceed with identifying these related components in the GMO ontology.
Based on the additional information and the search within the GMO ontology, here are the related components identified that align with the concepts described in the Funding Award pattern:

Object Properties
isFundedBy: Found references that may correspond to the concept of funding relationships between entities.
providesAgentRole: Identified references suggesting the assignment or provision of roles to agents within the context of funding awards.
Classes
FundingAward: Indications of a class or concept that aligns with the notion of a funding award within the ontology.
Agent: References to an agent class, which could represent individuals or organizations involved in funding awards.
AgentRole: Found mentions of roles that agents can perform, potentially including roles like SponsorRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, etc.
InformationObject: References to information objects, which could be used to describe additional information about funding awards such as identifiers and descriptions.
Data Properties
hasCurrencyValue: Identified properties that might be used to describe the monetary value associated with a funding award.
These findings suggest that there are components within the GMO ontology that align with or are related to the concepts of funding awards, roles, and associated attributes as described in the additional information you provided. The references to classes such as Agent, AgentRole, and FundingAward, along with object properties like isFundedBy and providesAgentRole, and the data property hasCurrencyValue, indicate that the GMO ontology may support modeling of funding awards and their associated details in a manner similar to what is described for the GBO ontology.

These connections and alignments between ontologies can facilitate semantic integration and interoperability between datasets or systems using these ontologies.

Object Properties: There are 48 instances of owl:ObjectProperty, which could include properties analogous to hasAward or other relevant relationships.
Inverse Properties: There are 21 occurrences of properties defined with owl:inverseOf, suggesting that inverse relationships are a common pattern, similar to hasAward and isAwardOf.
Domains and Ranges: There are 14 instances where either the domain (rdfs:domain) or the range (rdfs:range) is specified, which could relate to how Cruise and Award are defined in terms of their relationship.
Labels: There are 102 rdfs:label annotations, which might include labels that parallel ""hasAward"" or indicate other significant relationships.

I'll look for similarities or references that might correspond to the concept of ""isAwardOf"" or any interlinked concepts and properties.

I'll start by examining the ""gmo.ttl"" file to identify its structure and any connections to the concept you've described from the GBO ontology. Let's proceed with analyzing the content of the GMO ontology file.
The GMO ontology file you've uploaded starts with several namespace prefixes that define shorthand notations for frequently used URIs. For instance, rdf, owl, rdfs, and xsd are standard prefixes used in many ontologies for defining properties, types, and data types according to the RDF, OWL, and XML Schema specifications. The prefix glpv appears to be specific to the GMO ontology, mapped to http://gmo#.

To find pieces related to the GBO ontology's isAwardOf property, I will search through the GMO ontology for object properties, classes, or instances that might be conceptually similar or directly reference concepts from the GBO ontology. This could include properties that deal with awards, relationships between entities that could imply an awarding process, or any explicit mention of inter-ontology references.

I will now proceed to search the GMO ontology for relevant parts. ​​
I found 51 lines in the GMO ontology that might be relevant to the concept of ""isAwardOf"" from the GBO ontology or related concepts. However, from the initial sample reviewed, it appears that the specific lines identified do not directly mention awards or prizes but rather define various object properties and rules related to agents, spatial positions, and temporal aspects.

Given the nature of these findings, it seems there may not be a direct correlation or mention of ""isAwardOf"" or award-related concepts in the sample provided. The identified lines mostly pertain to agent roles, spatial relationships, and other object properties that don't immediately suggest a connection to awards.

These concepts are designed to describe the funding awards, their attributes, and the roles of different agents involved in the award process. To find related concepts in the GMO ontology, I will search for similar object properties, classes, and patterns that match or align with this comprehensive framework of funding awards.

Let's proceed to analyze the GMO ontology file again with this refined focus, searching for corresponding or conceptually similar elements.
The search through the GMO ontology with the refined focus has identified 199 lines that potentially match or are conceptually similar to the detailed ""Funding Award"" pattern you described. From the initial sample of these findings, it's evident that there are several concepts in the GMO ontology that align with those from the GBO ontology and the additional context you provided:

endsOnDate: Identified as an object property in the GMO ontology, similar to the endsOnDate property described in your context, likely used to mark the end date of a funding award.
providesAgentRole: There's a mention of an inverse property related to providesAgentRole, which suggests that the GMO ontology contains concepts for describing roles associated with agents in the context of information objects, aligning with the notion of agent roles in funding awards.
hasAgentRoleType: An object property that could be related to specifying the type of agent role, such as SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole.
These pieces indicate that the GMO ontology does contain elements related to funding awards, their properties, and associated roles, akin to those described in the ""Funding Award"" pattern. This includes properties for defining the end date of awards, and the roles agents play in relation to those awards.

Given the volume of findings (199 lines), it's clear that a comprehensive mapping or alignment between the GBO and GMO ontologies would require a detailed analysis of these elements to precisely determine their interrelations and equivalences.

Given the detailed description of the ""Funding Award"" pattern in GMO, including the properties and classes involved in modeling funding awards, roles, and associated entities, we can more accurately construct an equivalence rule that mirrors the relationship described in GBO.
Updated Analysis for Equivalence in ""GMO""
Class ""FundingAward"" in GMO corresponds to ""Award"" in GBO.
Object Property ""providesAgentRole"" in GMO can be used to connect a ""FundingAward"" to different roles, including ""PrincipalInvestigatorRole"" and ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"".
Constructing the Equivalence Rule
Given the ""GBO"" relationship:
""Award"" (x) ∧ ""hasCoPrincipalInvestigator"" (x, z)
The equivalent in ""GMO"", incorporating the additional details provided, would be:
""FundingAward"" (x) ∧ ""providesAgentRole"" (x, y) ∧ ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"" (y) ∧ ""isPerformedBy"" (y, z)
Here's the breakdown:
""FundingAward"" (x): Directly equates to the ""Award"" concept in GBO, representing the funding award.
""providesAgentRole"" (x, y): Connects a funding award to a role, which can include ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"".
""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"" (y): Specifies the role related to the funding award, equivalent to having a co-principal investigator in GBO.
""isPerformedBy"" (y, z): Links the role (e.g., CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole) to the person or organization performing it, closing the equivalence to ""hasCoPrincipalInvestigator"" in GBO.
This rule captures the relationship between a funding award and its co-principal investigator in GMO terms, reflecting the detailed ontology structure you provided.

There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern.
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc.

Here's how these concepts and relationships in GBO could potentially map to the described components in GMO based on your description:

GBO Concept ""Award"" is analogous to the GMO Class ""FundingAward"". The ""FundingAward"" class in GMO seems to encapsulate the idea of an award as it's described to fund various activities, similar to how an ""Award"" in GBO might function.
GBO Relationship ""isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z)"" suggests a relationship between a Co-Principal Investigator and an Award. In GMO, this relationship might be represented through a combination of properties and classes:
ObjectProperty ""isFundedBy"": Connects a project or activity to a ""FundingAward"", indicating the funding relationship.
Classes ""PrincipalInvestigatorRole"" and ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"": These roles likely correspond to the roles involved in the GBO ontology, with ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"" being directly relevant. The relationship between individuals (or agents) and the awards might be further detailed through properties like ""providesAgentRole"" and ""isPerformedBy"", indicating how individuals fulfill certain roles in relation to the funding.
To directly answer the query ""gbo:Award (z) ∧ gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf (x, z) ↔ gmo:?"", in GMO, this could be interpreted as:

An individual (x) fulfilling a ""CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole"" in relation to a ""FundingAward"" (z) where the ""FundingAward"" is connected to activities or projects it funds through the ""isFundedBy"" property. The detailed aspects of the award, such as the award amount, dates, and descriptive information, are managed through properties like ""hasAwardAmount"", ""startsOnDate"", ""endsOnDate"", and ""isDescribedBy"", and align with classes like ""AwardAmount"", ""TimeInstant"", and ""InformationObject"".
This interpretation is based on the assumption that the ""Funding Award"" pattern in GMO is designed to comprehensively represent the funding and roles related to research activities, much like the GBO ontology's handling of awards and investigator roles.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/5,0.6,,,2/5,0.6,,,,,

Specifically, I'll be looking for classes, properties, and instances that could be conceptually similar or connected to the concepts of ""Award,"" ""hasPrincipalInvestigator,"" and their related descriptions in the GBO ontology.

I will start by reading the ""gmo.ttl"" file to understand its structure and content. After that, I can identify any related parts. Let's begin with examining the contents of the ""gmo.ttl"" file.
The beginning of the ""gmo.ttl"" file shows the definition of various RDF prefixes that are used throughout the ontology. These include standard prefixes like rdf, owl, rdfs, and xsd, as well as specific ones for this ontology, such as glpv which is defined as http://gmo#. This suggests that the GMO ontology might use glpv as its primary prefix for defining classes, properties, and instances related to genetically modified organisms.

Given the structure and prefixes, I will now search through the entire file for classes, properties, or any other relevant pieces that could conceptually align with the GBO ontology parts you've mentioned, specifically:

Awards or similar funding-related concepts.
Principal investigators or related roles and relationships.
Let's proceed with a more detailed analysis to identify related parts. ​​
In the GMO ontology, several concepts and properties appear to be related to the GBO ontology parts you mentioned. Here's a summary of the related parts found:

associatedWithProgram: An object property that might relate to how awards or other entities are associated with a program, similar to the GBO concept of an award enabling participation.
FundingAward: Referenced as a range of a property, which directly correlates with the concept of an ""Award"" in GBO, indicating a connection to funding or grants.
hasAwardAmount: An object property possibly indicating the amount associated with an award, aligning with the financial aspect of an ""Award"" in GBO.
hasPersonName: While not directly mentioning ""Principal Investigator,"" this property suggests that personal information (like names) is modeled in the ontology, which could be part of or related to detailing principal investigators or persons.
These connections indicate that the GMO ontology includes concepts related to funding, awards, and personal information that might correspond to the structure and purpose of awards and principal investigator roles in the GBO ontology. Specifically, the associatedWithProgram and hasAwardAmount properties could serve similar roles to hasPrincipalInvestigator in the context of awards and funding. However, the direct correlation to ""Principal Investigator"" might not be explicitly defined or might be conceptualized differently in the GMO ontology.

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities.

It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217.

We should focus on identifying the GMO ontology's equivalent for a funding award (specifically, its connections to research activities, principal investigators, and the detailed structure surrounding funding information). Based on the detailed description of the funding award pattern and the properties and classes involved, we need to look for similar patterns in the GMO ontology that involve:

Funding awards or similar financial support concepts.
Connections to research activities or projects.
Roles related to the funding award, especially focusing on principal investigators.
Properties describing the funding award, such as start/end dates, amounts, and descriptions.
Any alignment with classes like Agent, TimeInstant, AgentRole, and the specific roles mentioned (SponsorRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, etc.).
With this refined focus, let's analyze the GMO ontology again to identify related concepts that align with this detailed structure of the GBO ontology's funding award pattern. I'll specifically look for object and data properties related to funding, time, descriptions, and agent roles, as well as any classes that correspond to the ones mentioned in your detailed description. Let's proceed with this more targeted analysis.
Based on the more targeted analysis of the GMO ontology, considering the detailed description of the funding award pattern provided, here are the findings that relate to the GBO ontology's structure:

AgentRole: Found a reference to agentRoleIn, which is an object property. This property connects a role to the entity in which the role is performed. It's related to AgentRole, indicating that GMO ontology has a concept of roles similar to those described in GBO, such as PrincipalInvestigatorRole, SponsorRole, etc.
providesAgentRole: The agentRoleIn property is the inverse of providesAgentRole, suggesting there's a mechanism to describe how agents (individuals or organizations) are related to their roles within the context of funding or projects, aligning with the providesAgentRole concept in GBO.
AgentRole and Program Association: There's also a mention of associatedWithProgram, which connects entities (potentially including funding awards) to programs, resembling the way GBO ontology might connect awards to research activities or programs.
While the detailed related concepts directly named in the GBO description (like FundingAward, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, TimeInstant, etc.) weren't explicitly found in the brief sample provided, the GMO ontology appears to model similar relationships and entities. Specifically, the concept of roles and their association with programs or activities, as indicated by agentRoleIn and associatedWithProgram, suggests a structural approach that could align with the funding award pattern described for GBO.

The GMO ontology seems to conceptualize agent roles and their involvement in projects or funding mechanisms in a way that could be aligned with the GBO's detailed pattern, especially around the roles and relationships within funding awards.

To fully align these ontologies, one might need to further explore the GMO ontology for explicit representations of funding awards, time-related properties, and detailed role classes.

I'll look for elements that may serve a similar purpose or have a semantic connection to funding, awards, or principal investigators within the context of genetically modified organisms.

I'll start by reading the content of the gmo.ttl file to understand its structure and find related components. Let's proceed with this analysis.
The GMO ontology file starts with a series of namespace prefixes that facilitate referencing various RDF resources and properties. It defines a base prefix for the ontology (http://gmo) and includes common namespaces such as rdf, rdfs, owl, and xsd, among others. This structure is typical for RDF files, indicating that the ontology includes classes, properties, and potentially instances that are described using these namespaces.

To find components in the GMO ontology that are related to the Award class and the isPrincipalInvestigatorOf object property from the GBO ontology, I'll search for elements that might be involved in the context of funding, grants, research roles, or similar concepts within the GMO ontology. This involves looking for classes or properties with similar labels or comments.

Let's proceed to identify such related components within the GMO ontology by parsing and analyzing its content. ​​
The search through the GMO ontology for components related to the Award class and the isPrincipalInvestigatorOf object property from the GBO ontology has identified several relevant elements. These components suggest the presence of a framework within the GMO ontology that deals with funding, organizational structures, and research roles, which may align with or complement the concepts represented in the GBO ontology:

PrincipalInvestigatorRole: This might correspond to roles associated with principal investigators, similar to the isPrincipalInvestigatorOf property in GBO.
CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole: Indicates a role similar to Principal Investigator, potentially serving as a counterpart or complementary role within research projects.
AwardAmount: This could relate to the financial aspect of an Award, detailing the funding amounts provided.
FundingAward: Directly aligns with the concept of an Award as mentioned in GBO, likely representing the funding or grants awarded for research.
Organization: Reflects organizational entities that might be involved in providing or managing awards and funding.
Agent: Could be related to individuals or entities (like principal investigators) that play a role in research projects or funding.
Cruise: While not directly related to funding or research roles, its presence among the results could indicate its association with research projects or activities that are funded.
hasSubOrganization: This property might relate to the structural hierarchy within organizations, possibly relevant in the context of managing or distributing awards and funding.
These components suggest that the GMO ontology includes a detailed representation of concepts related to research funding, organizational roles, and possibly the management and execution of funded research projects, which could complement or intersect with the themes of the GBO ontology regarding awards and principal investigators. ​​","you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info that can help: gboAward (z ) ∧ isPrincipalInvestigatorOf (x , z ) ↔ gmo:? what are the related concepts in GMO for this alignment rule?

The rule you provided (gboAward(z) ∧ isPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:?) seeks an equivalent or closely related pattern in the GMO ontology that captures the relationship between a funding award and its principal investigator, along with other aspects of funding awards.

From the description, the GMO ontology should ideally have concepts that correspond to the following aspects of the Funding Award pattern in GBO:

Funding Award and its properties:
isFundedBy: Links anything funded by the award.
startsOnDate and endsOnDate: Represent the temporal bounds of the award.
isDescribedBy: Connects to an information object detailing the award.
providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy: Define roles associated with the award.
hasAwardAmount and hasCurrencyCode (along with hasCurrencyValue): Describe the financial aspects of the award.
Classes that represent entities and roles involved in funding:
Agent (people or organizations involved in an award).
AgentRole, SponsorRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole (specific roles related to the funding process).
FundingAward, InformationObject, TimeInstant, AwardAmount, CurrencyCode (entities describing the award and its details).
Given these GBO concepts and the requirement for alignment, let's identify the related components in the GMO ontology. The key is to find GMO concepts that can serve the functions described by the properties and classes in GBO. This includes concepts for representing funding awards, roles of individuals and organizations in these awards, financial details of the awards, and the temporal aspects of these funding periods.

Considering the previously identified related components in the GMO ontology and this detailed description, I'll pinpoint the specific GMO concepts that align with this rule and provide a structured response on how they correlate. Let's proceed with identifying these alignments based on the detailed pattern description you've provided.
Based on the detailed pattern description provided and the initial identification of related components within the GMO ontology, I've attempted to map the GBO concepts to their potential counterparts or related concepts in GMO. This mapping aims to align with the rule provided and the broader context of the Funding Award pattern, focusing on research funding mechanisms and roles.

Here's an updated alignment based on the additional search for missing mappings:

FundingAward: Direct correspondence in GMO with FundingAward.
Agent: Matches with Agent in GMO, indicating individuals or organizations involved in a funding award.
PrincipalInvestigatorRole and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole: Direct matches found in GMO, indicating specific roles related to funding awards.
AwardAmount: Matches with AwardAmount in GMO, detailing the financial aspects of an award.
For the previously unknown mappings, we've identified some potentially related concepts in GMO:

ProgramManagerRole: Found ProgramManagerRole, which might correspond to AgencyProgramManagerRole in GBO.
occursAtTime, atTime, hasTemporalExtent: These properties in GMO could be related to temporal aspects of funding awards (e.g., startsOnDate, endsOnDate).
hasAgentRoleType, agentRoleIn: These properties suggest mechanisms for linking agents to their roles within the GMO ontology, potentially aligning with providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy in GBO.
While specific properties such as isFundedBy, isDescribedBy, hasCurrencyCode, and representations for InformationObject, TimeInstant, and CurrencyCode were not directly identified in the provided search results, the identified concepts and roles provide a foundation for mapping the structure of funding awards from GBO to GMO. The temporal properties (occursAtTime, atTime, hasTemporalExtent) and roles (ProgramManagerRole, hasAgentRoleType, agentRoleIn) suggest that GMO contains structures to represent funding periods, roles associated with funding awards, and possibly the financial and descriptive aspects of these awards, although more detailed analysis might be needed to find exact matches or to determine how these concepts are fully integrated within the GMO ontology.

This alignment illustrates how concepts related to funding awards, their temporal boundaries, financial details, and involved roles are represented within the GMO ontology, offering a basis for integrating or leveraging information between the GBO and GMO ontologies. ​​",FALSE,4/4,1,4/8,0.5,,,4/8,0.5,,,,,

The key concepts and relationships in your description include:

Funding Award with properties such as isFundedBy, startsOnDate, endsOnDate, and roles like SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole.
InformationObject to describe a funding award, including properties like isDescribedBy, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, hasAwardAmount, and hasCurrencyCode.
Various Classes like FundingAward, Agent, TimeInstant, AgentRole, InformationObject, AwardAmount, and CurrencyCode.
Given this information, I'll revisit the GMO ontology content to find related concepts that align with this Funding Award pattern, focusing on object properties and classes that match or are analogous to the ones described. This will include looking for concepts that represent funding awards, roles associated with funding, and any properties that connect awards to their funding sources, descriptions, amounts, and related agents.

Let's proceed to identify these related parts in the GMO ontology based on the detailed information you provided.
Based on the more detailed description you provided about the GBO ontology's Funding Award pattern, I revisited the GMO ontology and found several related concepts that might align with this pattern. Here's a summary of potentially related concepts found in the GMO ontology:

FundingAward: Found 11 occurrences, indicating there are concepts specifically related to funding awards.
Agent: A significant number of occurrences (654), suggesting a comprehensive representation of agents, which could include individuals and organizations involved in funding awards.
AgentRole: Similarly high occurrences (648), pointing to various roles agents can have, possibly aligning with roles like SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole.
InformationObject: Found 41 occurrences, which could relate to objects that describe funding awards, including identifiers, descriptions, etc.
AwardAmount: 13 occurrences, indicating the presence of concepts related to the amount of an award.
CurrencyCode: 11 occurrences, suggesting that the ontology includes concepts for representing currency codes.
providesAgentRole: Found 22 occurrences, which may relate to the property that connects agents to their roles within the context of a funding award.
hasAwardAmount: 5 occurrences, potentially relating to the property that connects a funding award to its amount.
hasCurrencyCode: 5 occurrences, possibly related to the property that specifies the currency code of an award amount.
However, no direct occurrences were found for TimeInstant, isFundedBy, isDescribedBy, and isPerformedBy. This could mean that these specific properties or classes are named differently or represented in a different manner within the GMO ontology.

Given the significant matches for classes and properties related to funding awards, agents, and their roles, it seems that the GMO ontology could be aligned with the GBO ontology's Funding Award pattern to some extent. The exact alignment would depend on the specific definitions and usage of these concepts within the GMO ontology.

I'll start by examining the structure of the file and providing a brief overview of its contents. Let's get started.
The ""gmo.ttl"" file you've uploaded is structured in Turtle syntax and defines various RDF prefixes for use within the document. These prefixes include common ones such as dc for Dublin Core Metadata, owl for Web Ontology Language, rdf and rdfs for RDF and RDF Schema, xsd for XML Schema Definition, and skos for Simple Knowledge Organization System. Additionally, it defines a custom prefix glpv associated with the namespace http://gmo#, which seems to be specific to the GMO ontology being defined.

gbo:Award(z) ∧ gbo:isProgramManagerOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:?

The alignment rule indicates a relationship in GBO involving an Award and a program manager (isProgramManagerOf relationship). You're asking how this aligns with the GMO ontology.

Based on the provided details, we see several concepts and properties in your description that could relate to this GBO concept within the context of funding awards and the roles associated with these awards in GMO:

FundingAward: This class is central to the funding award pattern and would naturally align with the gbo:Award concept, as it describes the funding awards.
AgencyProgramManagerRole: This class represents the role of a program manager, which could align with the gbo:isProgramManagerOf relationship, indicating the individual or organization managing the award.
ObjectProperties: The properties such as isFundedBy, startsOnDate, endsOnDate, isDescribedBy, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, hasAwardAmount, and hasCurrencyCode are used to describe the relationships and characteristics of a FundingAward. Although none of these properties directly correspond to the gbo:isProgramManagerOf relationship, providesAgentRole might be the closest in describing roles related to an award.
AgentRole and Its Subclasses: The AgentRole class and its subclasses (SponsorRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole) define various roles involved in a funding award. The AgencyProgramManagerRole specifically seems to be a direct counterpart to the GBO's concept of a program manager for an award.
Considering the alignment rule you're interested in and the details provided, it's likely that the AgencyProgramManagerRole within the GMO ontology is what you're looking for in terms of mapping to the gbo:isProgramManagerOf relationship. This class represents the role of a program manager in relation to a funding award, which would be the ""gmo:?"" part of your query, aligning with the concept of managing an award within the GMO context.

Given that the GBO ontology mentions an Award class with a comment and label, and an object property hasSponsor with specified domain, range, and an inverse property, I'll look for similar classes, properties, or concepts in the GMO ontology that might correlate with funding, awards, sponsorships, or organizational participation.

I'll start by examining the gmo.ttl file to identify relevant parts that might correspond or relate to the Award class and hasSponsor property from the GBO ontology. Let's begin with the analysis.
The beginning of the GMO ontology shows a set of prefix declarations, which are common in Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) files. These prefixes are used to define namespaces, making it easier to write the rest of the document without repeating long URIs.

Given the focus on finding parts of the GMO ontology related to the concepts of Award and hasSponsor as described in the GBO ontology, I will now search through the GMO ontology content for terms related to awards, funding, sponsorships, organizations, or participation. This involves looking for classes or properties that might represent these concepts or have relationships with them. Let's proceed with this search. ​​
In the GMO ontology, I found several relevant snippets related to the concepts of awards, funding, and organizations, which may correspond or relate to the Award and hasSponsor parts in the GBO ontology:

A property or class related to FundingAward with a range of agentrole:FundingAward.
An object property hasAwardAmount indicating the existence of an attribute or relation that might be used to specify the amount associated with an award.
An object property hasSubOrganization suggests the presence of hierarchical relationships between organizations, which might imply sponsorship or funding relationships indirectly.
A class AwardAmount, which likely represents the concept of an amount of money associated with an award.
These elements suggest that the GMO ontology contains concepts related to awards (possibly funding awards), the amounts tied to these awards, and organizational structures. Although there's no direct mention of a Sponsor class or property, the hasSubOrganization property might be used in contexts where sponsor relationships are modeled, especially in hierarchical organization structures.

Depending on your specific needs, these parts of the GMO ontology could potentially be aligned with or used in conjunction with the GBO ontology's Award and hasSponsor concepts, especially for applications involving funding, awards, and organizational participation.

The pattern describes a funding award that supports various research activities, with properties to connect entities to a funding award, define its duration, amount, and involved roles, including a SponsorRole. The alignment with gbo:Award and hasSponsor suggests we're looking for:

Funding Award concept in GMO that encompasses funding for research activities, which is directly mentioned as FundingAward.
The SponsorRole or equivalent that connects to the FundingAward in a manner similar to hasSponsor in GBO.
Properties that define the relationship between FundingAward and entities (possibly organizations or people) in roles akin to a sponsor, along with properties detailing the award's amount, duration, and description.

gbo:Award(x) in GBO can align with gmo:FundingAward in GMO, as both refer to the concept of an award or funding provided for research or activities.
gbo:hasSponsor(x, z) in GBO suggests a relationship where an award has a sponsoring entity. In GMO, this could be aligned with the concept of SponsorRole (an agent role involved in a funding award) and possibly the isFundedBy property, which connects an activity to a funding award, indicating sponsorship.
To encapsulate, the GBO rule gbo:Award(x) ∧ hasSponsor(x, z) might correspond in GMO to a pattern where a FundingAward is connected through isFundedBy to entities playing the SponsorRole.

This involves looking for similar or related classes and properties within the GMO ontology that could serve as equivalents, subclasses, superclasses, or any relevant association to the GBO ontology parts you've outlined.

I'll start by examining the contents of the ""gmo.ttl"" file you uploaded. Let's see what relevant information it contains.
The GMO ontology file you've uploaded starts with a series of prefix declarations, which is typical for Turtle syntax. These declarations include common prefixes like rdf, owl, rdfs, xsd, and some specific to this ontology, such as glpv which seems to be the prefix for the GMO ontology itself (http://gmo#).

To identify parts of the GMO ontology that relate to the ""Award"" class and the ""hasEndDate"" property from your GBO ontology, I'll need to search through the GMO ontology's content for related concepts. This could involve looking for classes or properties that deal with awards, funding, participation, time-related aspects (especially end dates), and possibly entities like datasets, meetings, or programs if they're also part of the GMO ontology.

Given the file's likely size and complexity, I'll focus on keywords and structures related to what you've described from the GBO ontology. Let's proceed with searching for relevant parts. ​​
Based on the content of the GMO ontology, there are several parts that seem relevant to the ""Award"" class and ""hasEndDate"" property you've described in your GBO ontology:

Funding Award and Award Amount:
The class FundingAward appears to be directly related to the concept of an ""Award"" as described in GBO, with mentions of it possibly being involved in various programs and activities, similar to the funding provided by an organization enabling participation.
There's also a class AwardAmount, which might pertain to the financial aspect of awards.
Associated Properties and Roles:
hasAwardAmount is an object property that could be related to the specifics of the award, such as its value or amount, which is aligned with the notion of ""Funding provided by an Organization"" as described for the ""Award"" class in GBO.
The property associatedWithProgram and the class AgencyProgramManagerRole suggest a structure where awards (funding) are connected to programs and roles within the organization, which may parallel the GBO concept where awards enable participation in various activities or projects.
Other Related Concepts:
Although the extracted segments do not directly mention a property equivalent to ""hasEndDate"", the focus on programs, funding awards, and their management roles implies a temporal aspect, which could be governed by properties similar to ""hasEndDate"" in managing the lifecycle of awards and programs.
This analysis suggests that the GMO ontology contains detailed representations of awards, their amounts, and the roles and programs associated with them, which likely serve similar purposes to what's described in the GBO ontology. The direct mapping for ""hasEndDate"" wasn't identified in the extracted content, but the structured nature of these entities suggests there could be similar properties to manage their temporal aspects.

Related GMO Concepts Based on Provided Information
Given the detailed description of the Funding Award pattern in GMO, the alignment can be mapped to the following GMO constructs:

Class: FundingAward directly corresponds to gbo:Award, focusing on funding awards for ocean science research activities.
Property for End Date: The endsOnDate object property in GMO aligns with the gbo:hasEndDate property. This property connects a FundingAward to its ending date, matching the semantics of having an end date for an award.
Start Date and Other Properties: While the rule focuses on the end date, it's worth noting that GMO also includes a startsOnDate property for the start date of a funding award, showing the temporal coverage of funding awards more comprehensively.
Additional Relevant Properties and Classes:
isFundedBy to connect activities or entities to a funding award.
providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy to describe roles associated with the funding award, aligning with people or organizations having roles in a funding award.
hasAwardAmount and hasCurrencyCode (with hasCurrencyValue as a data property) to detail the financial aspect of the award, akin to the award amount mentioned in the GBO.
Summary of Alignment

gbo:Award(x)∧gbo:hasEndDate(x,z)↔gmo:?, the related concept in GMO would be instances of the FundingAward class that are connected via the endsOnDate property to their end dates. This setup aligns with the semantic intent of the rule, providing a structured way to represent awards with an end date, along with additional context and attributes related to the funding process and its participants in ocean science research.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the specified parts in the GBO ontology, I'll need to analyze the contents of the gmo.ttl file you've uploaded. Specifically, I'll look for classes, properties, or instances that might relate to:

The concept of an Award or funding.
The property hasStartDate, which could be associated with events, programs, awards, datasets, or meetings in the context of GMO-related activities.
This will involve parsing the Turtle file to identify related RDF triples that match these criteria or have conceptual overlap. Let's proceed by examining the gmo.ttl file to find any relevant information.
In the GMO ontology, there are elements related to the concepts of an ""Award"" and the property ""hasStartDate"" from the GBO ontology. Here are some findings that might be of interest:

A class http://gmo#FundingAward that seems to correspond to the concept of an ""Award"" in GBO, with descriptions indicating it might be a subclass of another entity (details abstracted into blank nodes for RDF structure).
An object property http://gmo#hasAwardAmount, which, while not directly matching ""hasStartDate"", suggests the ontology includes properties related to attributes of awards, such as the amount.
Classes and properties like http://gmo#AwardAmount, indicating there's a structured approach to describing the financial aspects of awards within the GMO domain.
These elements suggest there are analogous concepts in the GMO ontology that relate to funding, awards, and potentially their attributes such as start dates, even if a direct counterpart to ""hasStartDate"" wasn't explicitly identified in this subset of related triples. The presence of classes and properties focusing on funding and awards indicates overlap in the domain of interest between GBO and GMO ontologies, particularly in how they represent and categorize funding-related information","""you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info that can help: gbo:Award(x) ∧ gbo:hasStartDate(x, z)↔ gmo:? what are the related concepts in GMO for this alignment rule?

The Funding Award pattern describes the funding awards that fund all kinds of ocean science research activities. We use the isFundedBy property to connect anything to a funding award if the funding award funds it. Each funding award has exactly one starting and ending date (aligned with time:Instant). It provides at most one award amount, which is described via a pair of decimal value and currency code. The currency code is not specified here, but existing standards can be used, e.g., ISO 4217. There may be people or organizations that have a role in a funding award. This is modeled by re-using (and aligning with) the Agent Role pattern.
In this version, we include the following types of agent-roles, represented as classes: SponsorRole, AgencyProgramManagerRole, PrincipalInvestigatorRole, and CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole. Additional roles are possible in the future versions.
Each funding award is described by a InformationObject, which when aligned to the Information Object pattern, allows one to represent additional information such as identifier, description, etc.

It's an object property (indicating a relationship between two individuals).
It has an inverse property isProgramOf.
Its domain includes instances of the classes Cruise or Document.
Its range is limited to instances of the class Program.
It is labeled ""hasProgram"".
Given this information, we're looking for elements in the ""gmo"" ontology that could align with these concepts, particularly focusing on:

Object properties that might serve a similar role as hasProgram or isProgramOf.
Classes analogous to Cruise, Document, and Program.
Any domain and range specifications for these properties that might match the structure given for hasProgram.
Let's examine the ""gmo"" ontology content to identify any such related parts.
In the ""gmo"" ontology, there are references to concepts that might be semantically related to the ""GBO"" ontology, specifically the terms ""Program"" and ""Cruise"". This suggests there could be constructs within the ""gmo"" ontology that are analogous or related to the object property hasProgram, its domain involving Cruise and Document, and its range being Program.

However, without further detail on how these terms are used within the ""gmo"" ontology (e.g., as classes, properties, or part of other constructs), it's challenging to provide a direct mapping or identify exact relations.

The presence of ""Program"" and ""Cruise"" within the ""gmo"" ontology indicates there could be potential overlaps or areas of interest between the two ontologies, especially in how these concepts are modeled or related to other elements within the ontologies.

If you need a more detailed analysis or specific mappings between the two ontologies, we would need to dive deeper into the structure and definitions within the ""gmo"" ontology, focusing on how ""Program"" and ""Cruise"" are defined and used.

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.
                                  ","Based on the additional information you've provided about the ""gmo"" ontology, we can identify several key concepts and properties that relate to the structure and details given for the ""GBO"" ontology's hasProgram property. The ""gmo"" ontology conceptualizes a ""Program"" in a broader and more flexible manner within the context of geoscience research, involving various elements such as cruises, funding awards, activities, and events. Here's how the details align with the elements from the ""GBO"":

isAssociatedWithProgram Property: This property in ""gmo"" is somewhat analogous to the hasProgram property in ""GBO"". While hasProgram directly associates certain entities like cruises and documents with a program, isAssociatedWithProgram serves a broader purpose by allowing any entity to be connected to a program. This includes, but is not limited to, cruises, which are explicitly mentioned in both ontologies.
Program as a Collection: Both ontologies use the concept of a program to group related entities, though ""gmo"" seems to take a more expansive view by including a wider range of entities like funding awards, activities, and events, in addition to cruises.
Agent Role Pattern Alignment: The mention of involving people or organizations in a program through the reuse and alignment with the Agent Role pattern indicates a structured approach to modeling the roles of individuals and groups within a program. This is relevant to the hasProgram property's implication of involving various entities and possibly their roles or contributions within the context of a program.
InformationObject Pattern for Program Information: The use of the InformationObject pattern to accommodate program-related information (e.g., name, webpage, description) in ""gmo"" suggests a detailed and structured approach to describing programs, which may align with how programs are considered within the ""GBO"" through the domain and range of the hasProgram property.
Given these alignments and conceptual overlaps, it's clear that while the specific properties and classes may not match one-to-one between ""gmo"" and ""GBO"", the underlying intent and modeling approach bear similarities, particularly in the flexible grouping of related entities under programs and the detailed modeling of program characteristics and associated roles.

The ""gmo"" ontology's use of isAssociatedWithProgram as a flexible property for linking diverse entities to programs, coupled with the detailed modeling of roles and program information, provides a comprehensive framework for representing complex relationships within geoscience research, which can parallel the relationships implied by the hasProgram property in ""GBO"".",FALSE,1/1,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find parts in the ""gmo.ttl"" ontology file that are related to the provided triples from the ""GBO"" ontology, we need to look for any references or similar patterns that match or relate to the concept of isProgramOf as an owl:ObjectProperty with the label ""isProgramOf"". This involves searching for object properties, labels, or any semantic linkage that could exist between the two ontologies based on naming conventions, relationships, or domain-specific contexts.

Given the information from the preview of the ""gmo.ttl"" file, we'll specifically look for:

Any object property definitions that might correspond to or interact with ""isProgramOf"".
Usage of similar labels or identifiers that might indicate a relationship.
Any explicit mentions or imports from the ""GBO"" ontology or related URIs, although this might be less likely without more context on how these ontologies are intended to interoperate.
Let's search the ""gmo.ttl"" content for these aspects.
Within the ""gmo.ttl"" ontology, there's a closely related object property to ""isProgramOf"" from the ""GBO"" ontology. The property agentrole:associatedWithProgram is defined as an owl:ObjectProperty with a label ""associatedWithProgram"". This property also specifies a range of agentrole:Program, indicating that it links entities to a concept of a program, similarly to how ""isProgramOf"" might link elements in the context of GBO.

Here's the specific definition and details related to associatedWithProgram in the GMO ontology:

Property URI: http://gmo#associatedWithProgram
Type: owl:ObjectProperty
Range: agentrole:Program
Label: ""associatedWithProgram""
This suggests that associatedWithProgram might serve a similar relational role in GMO as isProgramOf does in GBO, linking entities to programs or projects within their respective domains. If these ontologies are intended to be used together or aligned, this property could be a point of interoperability or semantic alignment between the two.

To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts you've identified in the GBO ontology, specifically the Program class and the hasCoPrincipalInvestigator property, I'll need to review the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded.

I'll start by examining the GMO ontology file for any classes, properties, or other entities that correspond to or have a semantic relationship with the Program class and hasCoPrincipalInvestigator property from the GBO ontology. This could include direct matches, related concepts, or structural similarities in how relationships and entities are defined.

Let me take a moment to analyze the GMO ontology file you uploaded to identify these connections.
The GMO ontology file begins with several namespace declarations, which are standard for RDF and Turtle syntax. This sets the groundwork for defining classes, properties, and instances within the ontology. To find entities related to the GBO ontology's Program class and hasCoPrincipalInvestigator property, I will look for classes that might serve a similar role as Program, and object properties that could correspond to hasCoPrincipalInvestigator, focusing on their definitions, domains, ranges, and any specified relationships or annotations that align with those in the GBO ontology.

Let's proceed to analyze the content further to identify these related parts. ​​
In the GMO ontology, we find entities that seem related to the Program class and the hasCoPrincipalInvestigator property from the GBO ontology:

For the ""Program"" class: There is a direct match with a class named Program within the GMO ontology. This suggests that there is a concept of a program, possibly with a similar context or meaning as in the GBO ontology, which is defined as a formally recognized scientific effort.
For the ""hasCoPrincipalInvestigator"" property: While there isn't a direct match for a property with the exact name hasCoPrincipalInvestigator, the GMO ontology contains a CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole class, which indicates there are entities designed to represent the role of a co-principal investigator within the context of the ontology. Additionally, properties such as associatedWithProgram, performedBy, and performsAgentRole could potentially relate to how a co-principal investigator is associated with a program or other entities within the GMO ontology.
This analysis highlights the possibility of semantic connections or analogies between the two ontologies regarding the concepts of programs and the roles of individuals (like co-principal investigators) within those programs. The direct presence of a Program class and the existence of a role-specific class for co-principal investigators in the GMO ontology suggest a structural and conceptual alignment with the GBO ontology's areas of focus you've highlighted.","""you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info about GMO that can help:

Let's synthesize the provided details with what we've found in the GMO ontology:

Connections and Equivalents in GMO
Program Context and Associations: In the GMO ontology, a program is described as a ""loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events,"" which aligns with the definition you've provided. The Program class we identified would serve as the primary entity for this concept. The isAssociatedWithProgram property is crucial here; it's intended to link various entities like funding awards or digital object records to a program. This property mirrors the flexible association capability you're looking for, similar to how the GBO ontology might connect different elements to a program.
Involvement of People or Organizations: The use of roles, specifically the AgentRole pattern, which includes roles like data manager, principal investigator, and co-principal investigator, provides a framework for connecting individuals or organizations with programs. This aligns with the GBO's hasCoPrincipalInvestigator property conceptually, as both ontologies use roles to define the involvement of people in programs. While we didn't find a direct match for hasCoPrincipalInvestigator, the presence of specific roles like CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole and properties that connect agents to roles or programs (e.g., performedBy, performsAgentRole) suggest a mechanism for modeling these relationships.
Other Information about Programs: The mention of using the InformationObject pattern to accommodate details like name, webpage, and description for a program suggests that the GMO ontology has a structured way to include descriptive metadata about programs. This approach is quite flexible and allows for the enrichment of program entities with a wide range of information, which is a parallel concept to what might be desired in the GBO ontology for detailing program-related data.
Summary
The provided details help to flesh out the relationships and entities within the GMO ontology that align with your interests in the GBO ontology:

The Program class directly corresponds to the concept of a program as a collection of related activities and entities.
The isAssociatedWithProgram property and the roles pattern (with specific instances like CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole) provide a structured way to model connections between programs, people, organizations, and other entities, aligning with the GBO ontology's approach to representing co-principal investigator relationships and program associations.
The use of the InformationObject pattern for detailing programs offers a flexible means to include additional information about programs, akin to the descriptive elements you might find in the GBO ontology.
These connections suggest that the GMO ontology has a comprehensive framework for modeling programs and their associated elements, roles, and metadata, offering parallels to the specific aspects of the GBO ontology you're focused on.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,1/4,0.75,,,1/4,0.75,,,,,

CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: This class likely represents the role of a Co-Principal Investigator within the GMO ontology, akin to the isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf property in the GBO ontology. It implies the existence of roles related to the conduct and management of investigations or research.
PrincipalInvestigatorRole Class: Directly related to the above, this indicates a role for Principal Investigators, suggesting a hierarchical or functional structure within research projects or programs.
These findings show that while the exact terms from the GBO ontology (Program and isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf) don't have direct counterparts in the GMO ontology (at least in the small preview we've explored), there are related concepts and roles. associatedWithProgram relates to program associations, and roles like CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole and PrincipalInvestigatorRole reflect the organization and responsibilities within research or academic projects, similar to what is outlined in GBO","you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info about GMO that can help:

can you complete this alignment rule:
gbo:Program(z ) ∧ gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf (x , z ) ↔ gmo","Given the additional information about how ""program"" is conceptualized within the GMO ontology—emphasizing a geoscience research community context, and considering the detailed description of relationships and roles associated with programs—it's clear that the alignment between the GBO and GMO ontologies should reflect these nuanced relationships.

The description outlines several key aspects to consider:

isAssociatedWithProgram Property: This property connects various elements (like cruises, funding awards, activities, events) to a program. It's a crucial link for aligning anything that can be part of a program in GMO with the Program concept in GBO.
Agent Role Pattern: This includes explicit mentions of data manager, principal investigator, and co-principal investigator roles. It's aligned with the involvement of people or organizations in a program, indicating how agent roles (including co-principal investigators) are modeled within programs.
InformationObject Pattern: This captures additional program details such as name, webpage, and description.
Based on these elements, the alignment rule you're looking for would likely involve linking the gbo:Program and gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf from GBO to corresponding elements in GMO that represent the program concept and the involvement of co-principal investigators, respectively.

Considering the description provided, a completion of the alignment rule could look like this:

gbo:Program(z) ∧ gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:Program(y) ∧ gmo:isAssociatedWithProgram(x, y) ∧ gmo:CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole(x)
This rule attempts to align the following:

gbo:Program(z) in GBO is aligned with gmo:Program(y) in GMO, recognizing the program entities in both ontologies.
gbo:isCoPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) in GBO is mapped to a combination of relationships and roles in GMO:
gmo:isAssociatedWithProgram(x, y) signifies that the same concept (x) associated with a program in GBO is also associated with a program in GMO.
gmo:CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole(x) ensures that the entity (x), which is a co-principal investigator of a program in GBO, has a corresponding role in GMO.
This mapping reflects the provided description, connecting items to programs via isAssociatedWithProgram and capturing the involvement of co-principal investigators through explicit role modeling.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To identify pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the specified parts in the GBO ontology, I'll first need to examine the contents of the ""gmo.ttl"" file you uploaded. Specifically, I'll look for any classes, object properties, and their relationships that might correspond or relate to the concepts of ""Program"" and ""hasPrincipalInvestigator"" as described in your GBO ontology excerpt.

I'll begin by reviewing the contents of the ""gmo.ttl"" file to identify relevant elements. This process involves checking for similar or related classes to ""Program"", and object properties analogous to ""hasPrincipalInvestigator"", including their domains, ranges, and any specific annotations such as comments or labels that might suggest a correspondence or relationship between the two ontologies.
The analysis of the ""gmo.ttl"" file revealed elements that relate to the concepts of ""Program"" and ""hasPrincipalInvestigator"" from the GBO ontology. Here's a summary of relevant findings in the GMO ontology:

Program: The GMO ontology defines ""Program"" similarly to the GBO ontology, as an owl:Class. It is labeled ""Program"" and likely carries a similar concept of a formally recognized scientific effort, although specific details like comments or definitions akin to those provided for GBO were not directly observed in the excerpted results. The concept of ""Program"" appears to be a fundamental class within the GMO ontology, indicating its importance in representing scientific efforts or projects.
Related Roles and Concepts: There are references to roles such as ""AgencyProgramManagerRole"" and ""ProgramManagerRole"", suggesting that the GMO ontology includes detailed representations of various roles associated with programs. This implies a structured approach to managing and categorizing the administrative and oversight responsibilities within scientific programs, which might be related to the management or oversight aspects that a ""Principal Investigator"" would have within the GBO context.
Connections and Hierarchies: The GMO ontology indicates hierarchical relationships where ""Program"" may be a subclass or connected to other classes through rdfs:subClassOf relations. This structure implies a nuanced categorization of programs and possibly related initiatives or efforts within the broader scientific and research domain captured by the ontology.
Comments and Descriptions: One detailed comment was found related to a ""Cruise"", highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of events, vessels, and trajectories within the ontology. While not directly related to ""Program"" or ""Principal Investigator"", this comment showcases the level of detail in describing scientific endeavors and their components within the GMO ontology. It suggests that programs may be involved in or associated with a wide range of scientific activities and projects, possibly including those like cruises which are detailed and specific events.
These findings suggest that the GMO ontology has a structured approach to representing scientific programs and roles related to program management and oversight. The presence of classes and roles that parallel those in the GBO ontology indicates potential areas of overlap or interoperability between the two ontologies, especially in the representation of scientific programs and the roles of individuals who lead or manage these programs. ​","you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info about GMO that can help:

what objects in the gmo can complete this complex rule? list them","Based on the detailed description you provided about the GMO ontology, let's analyze how it can relate to the GBO ontology, specifically to the concepts of Program and the property isPrincipalInvestigatorOf. The goal is to find GMO ontology objects that could logically complete the rule:

gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:isPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:?

Given the details:

Programs in GMO are described as loose collections of various entities (like cruises, funding awards, activities, events) grouped together under a program. This matches well with the description of a Program in GBO.
Roles in GMO, such as PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, and DataManagerRole, are specific types of AgentRole, which aligns with the role of isPrincipalInvestigatorOf in GBO.
Object Properties in GMO related to the roles and activities within a program include:
isAssociatedWithProgram: Connects various entities to a program.
providesAgentRole: Likely connects an agent to their role within the context of a program.
isPerformedBy: Connects roles to the agents performing them.
Given this information, to complete the rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:isPrincipalInvestigatorOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:?, we look for objects in GMO that represent the concept of a Program and the role of a Principal Investigator within such a program.

The equivalent GMO objects could be:

Program: Directly corresponds to the Program concept in GBO.
PrincipalInvestigatorRole: Equivalent to isPrincipalInvestigatorOf in GBO, representing the role of a principal investigator within a program.
Therefore, the rule could be represented in GMO as:

gmo:Program(x) for the program part.
For the principal investigator part, the property that connects an agent to their role as a principal investigator could be a combination of gmo:providesAgentRole (to specify the role associated with a program) and gmo:isPerformedBy (to specify who performs the role), with the role being gmo:PrincipalInvestigatorRole.
So, if we were to translate the GBO rule to a GMO equivalent considering these elements, it could look like:

gmo:Program(x) ∧ (gmo:providesAgentRole(x, y) ∧ gmo:isPerformedBy(y, z) ∧ y instance of gmo:PrincipalInvestigatorRole)

This rule suggests that for a given program x, there exists a role y (which is a PrincipalInvestigatorRole) associated with the program, and this role is performed by agent z.

Given this situation, let me approach this differently. I'll try to analyze the content of the GMO ontology file to identify any explicit references or similarities to the terms ""Program"", ""hasProgramManager"", ""isProgramManagerOf"", ""Award"", and ""Person"" mentioned in your GBO ontology.

I'll manually inspect the file's contents to find related information. Let's start by examining the file to identify any relevant triples. ​​
The preview of the GMO ontology file shows it uses several RDF and OWL vocabulary prefixes, suggesting a structured approach to defining concepts and relationships within the ontology. It mentions concepts like ""GeoLink Modular Ontology"" and includes various annotation properties.

However, without running a more detailed search or query through the entire content, it's challenging to pinpoint specific pieces related to the terms ""Program,"" ""hasProgramManager,"" ""isProgramManagerOf,"" ""Award,"" and ""Person"" directly from this preview.

Given the limitations of the current environment for executing complex SPARQL queries directly on the file content, the most effective way to proceed might be to explore specific sections of the file manually or use dedicated RDF tools outside of this environment.

If you have specific concepts or relationships in mind that you want to explore within the GMO ontology, or if there are particular parts of the file you're interested in, I can assist in analyzing those segments more closely.

In GBO, a Program is described as a formally recognized scientific effort, and the hasProgramManager relationship connects a Program to a Person acting in a managerial role.

In GMO, the concept of a Program is broader, encompassing a variety of activities, events, and roles within the context of geoscience research. The ontology includes properties and classes that could align with the concepts described in GBO:

isAssociatedWithProgram Property: This could be equivalent to or serve a similar purpose as gbo:hasProgramManager by associating various entities (like funding awards or digital object records) to a Program. However, it's more general and not specifically about managerial roles.
Agent Roles (PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole): These specific roles in GMO align with the management and operational aspects of a Program, which could be seen as analogous to having a Program Manager in GBO. The PrincipalInvestigatorRole or DataManagerRole could fulfill similar responsibilities as a Program Manager in the context of managing a program's execution or data.
Object Properties:
isAgentRoleIn: Could be used to indicate the role an agent (person or organization) plays in a program.
providesAgentRole: Might be used to connect a program with the roles it provides, potentially including a management or oversight role that could be analogous to gbo:hasProgramManager.
isPerformedBy: This property connects roles to agents, indicating who performs these roles, which could include managing a program.
Classes:
AgentRole: A superclass for specific roles like PrincipalInvestigatorRole, which could be seen as fulfilling the managerial functions within a program.
Agent: Represents individuals or organizations that could be managers of a program.
Based on these components, the completion of the complex rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasProgramManager(x, z) ↔ gmo:? in the context of GMO could involve several objects and properties, most notably:

The PrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole, or similar roles defined under AgentRole as they represent roles that could include program management responsibilities.
The isPerformedBy property to connect these roles to specific agents (individuals or organizations) managing the program.
Therefore, the completion of the rule in GMO terms could potentially involve the connection of a Program to individuals fulfilling PrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole, or similar through the use of isPerformedBy and possibly providesAgentRole to specify the managerial roles associated with a program.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the given parts in the GBO ontology, specifically the Program class and the isProgramManagerOf object property, I will first look into the gmo.ttl file you've uploaded. I'll examine the content for any classes, properties, or concepts that are similar or could logically relate to the idea of a ""Program"" or the relationship denoted by ""isProgramManagerOf"" in the GBO ontology.

Let's start by reading the content of the gmo.ttl file to identify relevant parts.
The GMO ontology file begins with the definition of prefixes, which is standard for Turtle files, to abbreviate URIs for more readable specifications. The gmo prefix is defined along with other common prefixes such as rdf, rdfs, owl, and xsd. There's also a specific prefix for the ontology itself (glpv: <http://gmo#>), which is likely where we'll find the relevant concepts related to the GBO ontology's Program class and isProgramManagerOf property.

Given the large scale of ontologies, to find pieces in the GMO ontology related to the Program class and isProgramManagerOf property in the GBO ontology, I'll search the content for keywords or constructs that might relate to:

Formal scientific efforts or programs
Management or managerial roles
Let's conduct a search through the content based on these criteria. ​​
Based on the content extracted from the GMO ontology, there are elements that could relate to the Program class and the isProgramManagerOf property from the GBO ontology:

associatedWithProgram Object Property: This is defined as an object property in the GMO ontology, similar to the isProgramManagerOf in the GBO. It indicates a relationship where an entity (possibly an agent or an event) is associated with a program. This suggests a conceptual linkage to managing or being part of a program, albeit with a broader association rather than the specific managerial role implied by isProgramManagerOf.
AgencyProgramManagerRole Class: This class directly relates to a managerial role within a program, aligning closely with the concept of Program and the property isProgramManagerOf in the GBO ontology. The AgencyProgramManagerRole is described as having a property (associatedWithProgram) that potentially connects it to specific programs, similar to how a program manager would be connected to a program in the GBO ontology.
Program Concepts: There is a mention of being ""associated with some program"" in the context of funding and organizational structures, indicating that the concept of a program, as understood in the GBO ontology, is also relevant in the GMO ontology, particularly in relation to funding and agency roles.
These findings suggest that the GMO ontology includes concepts and properties that can be related to or mapped onto the Program class and the isProgramManagerOf property of the GBO ontology. The associatedWithProgram property and the AgencyProgramManagerRole class are particularly relevant and could serve as points of integration or comparison between the two ontologies","you couldn't give me all the pieces I need in GMO. here is more info about GMO that can help:

Given the detailed information about how programs and related concepts are modeled within the GMO ontology, and the need to find counterparts to the GBO's Program class and the isProgramManagerOf relationship, let's analyze the provided details to identify which objects in GMO could complete the complex rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:isProgramManagerOf(x, z) ↔ gmo:?.

From the description, the GMO ontology models programs as collections of various entities (like cruises, funding awards, activities, events) and involves different roles (like data manager, principal investigator, co-principal investigator) associated with these programs. The key concepts and object properties introduced or mentioned that might relate to the GBO's Program and isProgramManagerOf are:

Program - As a class, it represents the collection of entities as described, which aligns with the GBO's concept of a Program.
isAssociatedWithProgram - An object property to connect any entity to a Program. This is broader than isProgramManagerOf but is essential in establishing relationships with programs.
AgentRole (including PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole) - These roles are specialized types of AgentRole that could be involved in a program. They model the involvement of people or organizations in a program, potentially similar to the managerial role described by isProgramManagerOf in GBO.
providesAgentRole - An object property that could relate to assigning or acknowledging the role of an agent within the context of a program, which may include managerial roles.
isPerformedBy - Another object property that signifies actions or roles being performed by agents, which might be used to express the performance of managerial duties within a program.
To construct a complex rule that equates to gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:isProgramManagerOf(x, z) in the GMO ontology, considering the details provided, the most relevant constructs would involve the Program class, the roles that indicate management or leadership within a program (like PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole), and properties that establish relationships between programs and agents (isAssociatedWithProgram, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy).

Given this analysis, the completion for the complex rule could involve multiple components in GMO, representing the program concept and the managerial roles within it. The exact representation would depend on the specific use case and how closely one wishes to model the managerial relationship as depicted in GBO.

A potential representation in GMO could be something like:

gmo:Program(x) to represent the program entity.
gmo:providesAgentRole or gmo:isPerformedBy combined with gmo:PrincipalInvestigatorRole or similar roles to model the managerial aspect of the relationship.
This interpretation assumes that gmo:Program equates to gbo:Program in context, and the managerial roles and properties in GMO serve a similar purpose to gbo:isProgramManagerOf, connecting managerial roles to programs.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

The additional context you provided about the GMO ontology and its conceptualization of a program, along with the relationships and classes involved, helps in understanding how to map or relate the GBO Program class and hasAcronym property to the GMO ontology.

Given the detailed description, we see that Program in the context of the GMO ontology involves various aspects, including but not limited to:

Association with other entities through isAssociatedWithProgram.
Description and temporal aspects through isDescribedBy, startsOnDate, and endsOnDate.
Involvement of different roles, such as PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, and DataManagerRole.
The complex rule you're asking to complete, gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasAcronym(x, z) ↔ gmo:?, suggests you're looking for an equivalent or similar construct in the GMO ontology that can relate to both the notion of a Program and its acronym within the GMO context.

Considering the elements described, we'll focus on identifying GMO components that can fulfill this mapping:

Program-related Entities: Classes and properties directly involved in defining or relating to a program.
Acronym Representation: While the detailed description doesn't directly mention acronyms, the closest equivalent might involve identification or labeling properties that can serve a similar purpose.
Let's deduce the possible candidates from the provided information that could complete this rule by fitting into the conceptual framework of the GMO ontology.
Based on the detailed description you provided, the complex rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasAcronym(x, z) ↔ gmo:? seems to seek an equivalent representation in the GMO ontology, particularly focusing on how programs are described and related to other entities, including their identification through acronyms or similar properties.

In the GMO context, a program is conceptualized with various relationships and roles, notably through the properties like isAssociatedWithProgram, isDescribedBy, and roles such as PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, and DataManagerRole. Given this, we can infer the following GMO components that might complete the rule, aligning with the description and structure you've provided:

Program Representation:
The class Program itself, as defined in the GMO, which is a central concept related to geoscience research community activities.
The property isAssociatedWithProgram, which connects various entities (e.g., activities, events, people) to a program.
Description and Identification:
The use of InformationObject pattern for describing programs, which likely includes properties for name, webpage, description, which could inherently accommodate or resemble an acronym-like property for identification purposes.
Since explicit mention of an acronym handling is not provided, it's conceivable that the descriptive elements of a program (potentially within InformationObject) might include or be used to represent acronyms.
Temporal and Role-Based Relationships:
Properties such as startsOnDate, endsOnDate, providesAgentRole, and isPerformedBy, which define temporal aspects and roles associated with a program.
Given these components, the completion of the rule could involve multiple aspects in GMO, such as:

The Program class for the entity itself.
Descriptive and identification properties within the InformationObject pattern that could serve to include or imply acronym information.
The isAssociatedWithProgram property for linking entities to programs.
Therefore, the rule could conceptually be mapped to the GMO ontology through a combination of the Program class, its descriptive aspects (potentially within InformationObject for acronym-like information), and the relationships established by properties like isAssociatedWithProgram.

This mapping isn't a direct one-to-one correlation due to the different ontological structures and focuses of GBO and GMO, but it captures the essence of the Program representation and its associated identification and relationships within the GMO context.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,1/4,0.75,,,1/4,0.75,,,,,

Given the detailed structure around ""Program"" in GMO, including properties like isAssociatedWithProgram, roles such as PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, DataManagerRole, and the involvement of InformationObject and TimeInstant for marking start and end times, we can infer the completion of the rule based on the end date association.

The gbo:hasEndDate(x, z) predicate suggests we're looking for an equivalent in GMO that denotes the ending time or date of a program. In the GMO ontology description, the closest match to this would be the property or relationship that connects a program to its end time, which is outlined as follows:

endsAtTime Property: This property is directly mentioned as being associated with a ""Program"" to mark its end time, aligning with the concept of gbo:hasEndDate.
Therefore, for the rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasEndDate(x, z) ↔ gmo:?, the equivalent in GMO that connects a program to its end date, considering the properties and classes you described, would be:

gmo:Program(x) being associated with gmo:endsAtTime(x, z), where x is an instance of a Program and z is a specific point in time (TimeInstant) marking the end of the program.
This completion of the rule reflects the structured way in which the GMO ontology models programs, their durations, and the roles involved, specifically focusing on the property that marks the end of a program in a manner akin to gbo:hasEndDate.

To identify pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the parts you've described in the GBO ontology, I'll need to examine the gmo.ttl file you've uploaded. I'll look for concepts and properties in the GMO ontology that might correspond to or have relationships with the Program class and the hasStartDate property from the GBO ontology.

I'll start by reading the contents of the gmo.ttl file to understand its structure and to find any related parts. Let's proceed with that.
The contents of the GMO ontology file begin with namespace declarations, which are standard in RDF and OWL ontologies to define prefixes for frequently used URIs. This makes the file easier to read and write by avoiding the repetition of long URIs.

Given the brief look at the beginning of the file, it's clear that the ontology defines a variety of concepts, likely including classes and properties relevant to genetically modified organisms. To find components related to the Program class and the hasStartDate property as you described in the GBO ontology, I will search the content for:

Classes that might correspond to or be equivalent to Program.
Properties similar to hasStartDate, which could be used to indicate the start date of a program or related entities.
Let me analyze the entire file content to identify these related parts. ​​
In the GMO ontology, there is a mention of ""Program,"" suggesting there's a component related to the Program class you described in the GBO ontology. However, there doesn't appear to be a direct mention of hasStartDate or a property that directly corresponds to it based on the initial search.

Since ""Program"" is present, this might imply the existence of a class or concept within the GMO ontology that aligns with the notion of a program as defined in GBO. The absence of a direct mention of ""hasStartDate"" suggests that the GMO ontology may use a different property to denote the start dates of programs or related entities, or it might not explicitly model this information.

To provide more detailed information, I can look further into the ontology to extract the exact definitions or descriptions related to ""Program"".

        A program in the context of geoscience research community is a loose collection of things, including cruises, funding awards, activities, events, which are loosely grouped together. We model program in the Program pattern stub in Figure 11.1. First, we introduce isAssociatedWithProgram property, which can be used to connect anything to an instance of Program. For instance, if one wants to connect funding awards or digital object records to programs, (s)he could use this property. Next, any involvement of people or organization in the program can be modeled through the re-use of (and alignment with) Agent Role pattern. In this version of the pattern, we explicitly include data manager role, principal investigator role, and co-principal investigator role. Other kinds of agent-roles are possible in the future. Finally, other information regarding a program, e.g., name, webpage, description, etc., can be accommodated thorugh the use of InformationObject pattern.

Given the additional information about how programs and related properties are modeled in the GMO ontology, it appears that the concept of a ""Program"" in GMO is quite rich and multifaceted, incorporating aspects like associations with other entities (e.g., cruises, funding awards, activities, events), roles of individuals or organizations (e.g., data manager, principal investigator, co-principal investigator), and temporal properties (e.g., start and end dates).

The description also introduces several key concepts and object properties, including:

isAssociatedWithProgram: to connect entities to a program.
isDescribedBy: linking programs to information objects (and vice versa), which could include name, webpage, and description.
startsOnDate and endsOnDate: to represent the start and end times of a program, though it's worth noting these exact properties were not directly found in the initial search.
Agent roles like PrincipalInvestigatorRole, CoPrincipalInvestigatorRole, and DataManagerRole, indicating the involvement of people or organizations in the program.
Considering the complex rule you're interested in mapping between GBO and GMO — specifically gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasStartDate(x, z) ↔ gmo:? — we're looking for objects in GMO that can complete this rule by representing both the concept of a program and its associated start date.

Based on your description, the equivalent GMO rule components might involve:

Program class to represent the concept of a program.
startsOnDate (or a similar property like startsAtTime) for indicating the start date of a program.
However, since startsOnDate wasn't directly found, but startsAtTime was mentioned, we'll consider startsAtTime as the closest equivalent based on the context provided. Thus, an entity in GMO that could fulfill the given complex rule from GBO might be something along these lines:

Use Program for the concept of a program.
Use startsAtTime to represent the start date of the program.
To complete the complex rule gbo:Program(x) ∧ gbo:hasStartDate(x, z) ↔ gmo:?, the corresponding GMO parts could be formulated as follows:

gmo:Program(x) to match the program concept.
gmo:startsAtTime(x, z) to indicate the start date of the program.
So, the objects in GMO that can complete this complex rule are Program (for the program concept) and startsAtTime (or potentially another similar property if startsAtTime doesn't exactly fit) for the start date of the program. This aligns with the patterns you've described for how programs and their temporal aspects are modeled in the GMO ontology.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,0,1,startsAtDate doesn't exist it is startsAtTime,,0,1,,,,,

Let me start by examining the ""gmo.ttl"" file to identify relevant parts. Please hold on for a moment.
The ""gmo.ttl"" file begins with a series of namespace prefixes that are essential for understanding the structure and relationships within the ontology. It includes standard prefixes like rdf, owl, rdfs, and xsd, as well as specific ones like glpv which appears to be the prefix for the GMO ontology itself, indicated by <http://gmo#>.

To find parts of the GMO ontology related to the concept of ""Organization"" as described in your GBO ontology snippet, I'll look for classes, comments, and labels within the GMO ontology that match or are conceptually similar to ""Organization"". This includes searching for the term ""Organization"" and examining related concepts like ""Agent"" or any formally recognized collection of agents. Let's proceed with this analysis. ​​
Within the GMO ontology, I found references that could potentially relate to the concept of ""Organization"" as described in the GBO ontology. Here are some relevant parts:

Agent Role Relationships: There are object properties related to the roles of agents within organizations, such as agentrole:hasAgentRoleType and agentrole:performsAgentRole. These suggest a structured approach to defining how agents (which could be individuals or entities) interact with or within organizations.
Sub-Organizations: The property agentrole:hasSubOrganization indicates a relationship that allows for the representation of hierarchical or nested organizational structures. This directly relates to the concept of an organization being a ""collection of Agents in some formally recognized capacity,"" as it implies the capability to delineate complex organizational frameworks.
These findings suggest that the GMO ontology includes concepts and properties that relate to organizational structures, agent roles, and hierarchical relationships within organizations, closely aligning with the ""Organization"" concept outlined in your GBO ontology.

This pattern describes organizations, as depicted in Figure 9.1. Organizations, as modeled here, have two important characteristics. First, organizations (represented by Organization as the main class) are agents. That is, they can perform some agent-roles in certain situations. Second, organizations may provide agent-role that can be performed by agents, including persons and other organizations (hence the use of providesAgentRole property).
A type of role that an organization can definitely provide is affiliation-role (via AgentAffiliationRole class). In particular, affiliation-role that is performed by a person is important in the context of GeoLink, hence the PersonAffiliationRole class. For the sake of symmetry, OrganizationAffiliationRole class is also provided. Note that PersonAffiliationRole is always performed by a Person, whereas a OrganizationAffiliationRole is always performed by an Organization.
The introduction of PersonAffiliationRole motivates a local definition of Person class. Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern.
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through
the hasSubOrganization property.

Organizations as Agents: Organizations are modeled as agents, implying they can perform roles in certain situations, which aligns with the Agent and Organization classes.
Agent Roles and Affiliation Roles:
Organizations can provide roles (providesAgentRole property) that can be performed by agents, including both persons and other organizations.
Specific roles such as AffiliationRole are provided by organizations, with PersonAffiliationRole and OrganizationAffiliationRole indicating roles performed by persons and organizations, respectively.
Class Definitions and Relationships:
Both Organization and Person are defined locally and declared as subclasses of Agent, indicating their capability to act within the system.
The ontology also details the relationships and actions these entities can partake in, such as being described by information objects (isDescribedBy property), performing roles (isPerformedBy property), and having a hierarchical structure through hasSubOrganization.
Given these details, the objects in GMO that can complete the complex rule gbo:Organization(x) ↔ gmo:? by drawing parallels to the described characteristics are:

To provide an accurate response, I'll need to inspect the contents of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. I will look for elements within the GMO ontology that may correspond or relate to the classes and properties defined in your GBO ontology, specifically focusing on concepts such as ""Organization,"" ""isCountryOf,"" and ""fromCountry."" Let's start by examining the GMO ontology file for related classes and properties.
The GMO ontology begins with a set of namespace prefixes similar to what you described for the GBO ontology. It includes standard RDF, RDFS, OWL, and XSD prefixes, along with specific ones for the GMO itself (indicated as http://gmo# and abbreviated as glpv:).

To identify pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the GBO parts you're interested in—specifically ""Organization,"" ""isCountryOf,"" and ""fromCountry""—I'll search the GMO ontology for classes and properties that either match these names or are conceptually similar based on descriptions, labels, or relationships.

Let me proceed with this analysis. ​​
The search within the GMO ontology revealed the following related to your query:

Organization: There are 15 instances or references to ""Organization"" within the GMO ontology. This suggests there are classes, properties, or comments related to the concept of an organization, similar to what's defined in your GBO ontology.
isCountryOf: No direct references or related instances were found. This indicates the GMO ontology might not explicitly define or use a property that directly corresponds to ""isCountryOf"" as it's described in GBO.
fromCountry: Similarly, no direct references or related instances for ""fromCountry"" were found in the GMO ontology.
Given the absence of direct matches for ""isCountryOf"" and ""fromCountry,"" but with several references to ""Organization,"" it seems worthwhile to explore what's specifically said about organizations within GMO. This can help us understand if there's an analogous way that GMO might deal with country-related concepts or if there are other properties that implicitly cover similar relationships.

Let's examine the context around the mentions of ""Organization"" to understand how it's conceptualized within the GMO ontology. ​​
The excerpts from the GMO ontology regarding ""Organization"" suggest the following insights:

There is a direct definition or reference to an Organization class within the GMO ontology, as indicated by the line ### http://gmo#Organization. This parallels the definition in your GBO ontology, suggesting a conceptual similarity in how both ontologies treat organizations.
The property hasSubOrganization is mentioned, indicating a hierarchical or structural relationship between organizations within the GMO ontology. This could imply a way of organizing entities that might be analogous to some relationships you're interested in with ""isCountryOf"" and ""fromCountry"" but focused within the scope of organizational structures.
The specific mentions of ""Organization"" and the presence of a property like ""hasSubOrganization"" hint at a structured approach to representing organizations within the GMO ontology, possibly mirroring aspects of the organizational concepts in your GBO ontology but not directly addressing country-related properties.

Given this context, it seems the two ontologies might share thematic areas but differ in their specific focuses—GMO appears to delve into organizational structures and hierarchies, while GBO includes explicit geographic or country-related properties.

If you're looking for integration or alignment strategies between these two ontologies, considering how organizational concepts are framed in each could be a starting point, especially in the absence of direct geographic linkage in GMO.

Now, since we have both Organization and Person locally defined, instead of aligning Organization directly to the Agent and Agent Role patterns, we introduce a local definition of Agent, declare Organization and Person as its subclass, and then align it with Agent in both Agent and Agent Role patterns. In addition, Person is align to the Person class in Person pattern.
Other information about an organization is modeled through the use of Information Object pattern. We introduce OrganizationInformationObject as its subclass (via alignment). This is to accommodate infor- mation items specific only for organizations. Currently, only country and canonical name information are included here (the latter is included since we want to assert that such a canonical name always exists for an organization). Finally, this pattern also allows a partonomic relationship between organization through
the hasSubOrganization property.

what objects in the gmo can complete this complex rule? list them","Given the additional details about the GMO ontology, we can now look for how it might relate to the GBO ontology's specific use of Organization and isCountryOf. Based on the description, the GMO ontology includes several relevant concepts:

Organizations as Agents: Organizations can perform roles that are typically associated with agents, indicating the Agent class might be a central element in understanding the organizational structure within GMO.
Agent Roles and Affiliation Roles: The ontology specifies roles that organizations can provide, including affiliation-role through AgentAffiliationRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole, and PersonAffiliationRole. This suggests a rich structure for describing the capacities and relationships of organizations.
Information about Organizations: The ontology uses OrganizationInformationObject to model specific information about organizations, including their country (through hasCountryLocation) and canonical names.
Partonomic Relationships: The hasSubOrganization property indicates hierarchical relationships between organizations.
Given these concepts, if we want to express the GBO rule gbo:Organization(x) ∧ isCountryOf(x, y) in terms of the GMO ontology, we need to identify elements that define an organization's relationship to a country. From your description, the most directly relevant GMO properties and classes seem to be:

Organization: As the primary class for organizations.
hasCountryLocation: An object or data property that could express the country an organization is associated with, similar to isCountryOf.
Country: Presumably, the class representing countries within the GMO.
Therefore, the complex rule from GBO involving Organization and isCountryOf could be represented in the GMO ontology by using the Organization class in combination with the hasCountryLocation property to link to a Country instance.

This translation assumes that hasCountryLocation is the property used within GMO to denote the country an organization is associated with or operates in, mirroring the isCountryOf relationship in GBO. Without direct access to the definition of hasCountryLocation in the GMO ontology text you provided, this interpretation best aligns with the described modeling pattern and the information you've shared.

If hasCountryLocation is indeed an object property linking organizations to countries, then the translation could be represented as:

GBO Rule: gbo:Organization(x) ∧ isCountryOf(x, y)
GMO Equivalent: gmo:Organization(x) ∧ hasCountryLocation(x, y)

ObjectProperty: hasSubOrganization: Directly mentioned in your description, this property in GMO is likely the direct counterpart to gbo:hasSubOrganization. It signifies a partonomic (part-of) relationship between organizations, indicating that one organization is a subpart or subsidiary of another.
Class: Organization: As the primary class involved in the hasSubOrganization relationship, instances of this class would be the subjects and objects of triples using the hasSubOrganization property.
Given the context provided, the following components of the GMO ontology could complete the complex rule involving gbo:hasSubOrganization(x,y) by either being directly involved or playing a complementary role in expressing organizational structures and affiliations:

Organization (Class): The main entity involved in hasSubOrganization relationships.
hasSubOrganization (ObjectProperty): Directly represents the partonomic relationship where one organization is a subpart of another.
providesAgentRole (ObjectProperty): Although not directly analogous to hasSubOrganization, it indicates a relationship where an organization offers roles that can be filled by agents, reflecting the organizational structure and its roles.
Agent (Class): As organizations are considered agents capable of performing roles, the Agent class is indirectly related to the hasSubOrganization structure by defining the entities that can engage in such relationships.
AgentRole, AgentAffiliationRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole, PersonAffiliationRole (Classes): These classes detail the types of roles organizations and persons can have within the broader context of the ontology, influencing the understanding of how organizations are structured and interact.
This interpretation assumes a direct mapping or relationship between the specific properties and classes in GMO to those mentioned in GBO. However, without direct access to query the ontology or a detailed view of its structure, this analysis is based on the descriptive information provided.

I'll take a different approach to address your question about finding parts in the GMO ontology that are related to the ""isSubOrganizationOf"" object property in the GBO ontology.

Since direct querying did not work as expected, let's discuss the general strategy for identifying related parts without executing the query. In an ontology, to find parts related to a specific object property like ""isSubOrganizationOf"", you would generally look for:

Equivalent Object Properties: Check if there are any object properties in GMO declared as equivalent to ""isSubOrganizationOf"" from GBO.
Sub-properties: Investigate if GMO contains any sub-properties of ""isSubOrganizationOf"". These would be more specific relationships that fall under the broader category defined by ""isSubOrganizationOf"".
Domain and Range: Look at the classes (or types of entities) that are connected by ""isSubOrganizationOf"" in GBO and find similar or related classes in GMO. Then, check for properties in GMO that link these classes.
Annotations and Labels: Sometimes, properties can be related through their annotations or labels. If ""isSubOrganizationOf"" has a specific label, other properties with similar labels or descriptions in GMO might be relevant.
This approach requires analyzing the structure and annotations within the GMO ontology. Given the issue with executing the query directly, you might need to inspect the ontology using ontology editing tools like Protégé, or by manually examining the ontology file if it's not too large.

Given the context and entities involved in GMO, it sounds like you're interested in how organizations are structured and related to each other within this ontology. The information suggests that organizations can have a partonomic relationship with one another, which is crucial for understanding their hierarchy and affiliations.

From your description, the direct counterpart in GMO for GBO's isSubOrganizationOf seems to be the hasSubOrganization object property. This property likely denotes a partonomic (part-whole) relationship between organizations, similar to what isSubOrganizationOf represents in GBO.

The pattern you described emphasizes organizations, their roles, affiliations, and how they're interconnected, focusing on aspects such as agent roles, affiliations, and hierarchical structures. The hasSubOrganization property directly implies a hierarchical, organizational structure where one organization is a subset or part of another.

Therefore, for the rule gbo:isSubOrganizationOf(x,y) ↔ gmo:?, the equivalent or related expression in GMO based on the provided context would be gmo:hasSubOrganization(x, y). This means, in the context of the provided GMO ontology, hasSubOrganization would serve the purpose of establishing a partonomic relationship between organizations, similar to what isSubOrganizationOf does in GBO.

To summarize, based on your detailed description, the following GMO pieces seem to be directly related to the GBO's isSubOrganizationOf:

ObjectProperty: hasSubOrganization
Class: Organization
Additionally, related concepts such as providesAgentRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole, and Agent play supportive roles in defining the organizational structures and affiliations, which might be contextually relevant but are not the direct equivalents.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","The GMO ontology begins with a series of prefix declarations that are essential for understanding the structure and relationships within the ontology. These prefixes include common ones like rdf, rdfs, owl, and xsd, as well as specific to the GMO ontology, such as glpv which appears to be the prefix for the namespace http://gmo#. This gives us a starting point to look for classes or properties related to ""Person"", as described in your GBO ontology.

Given the information you've provided about the GBO ontology, we'll search the GMO ontology for entities related to the concept of ""Person"". This could include classes directly related to Person, properties that might be used to describe a Person, or any other relevant pieces. Let's proceed to identify these related pieces. ​​
In the GMO ontology, several pieces relate to the concept of ""Person"" and ""Agent"", which might be of interest given your description of the GBO ontology. Here are some key findings:

Agent Roles:
An owl:ObjectProperty named agentrole:providesAgentRole is mentioned, which is inversely related to something unspecified in the excerpt provided. This suggests a concept related to the roles of agents or persons.
The domain for this property is specified as agentrole:AgentRole, indicating the existence of an AgentRole class or concept within the GMO ontology.
Person Name:
There is an owl:ObjectProperty named agentrole:hasPersonName, which is a sub-property of agentrole:hasPersonalInfoItem. This property is likely used to specify a person's name within the ontology, making it directly relevant to the concept of a ""Person"".
Personal Information Item:
The reference to agentrole:hasPersonalInfoItem suggests there are properties designed to encapsulate personal information about agents or persons within the GMO ontology.
These pieces indicate that the GMO ontology includes concepts related to personal information, specifically names and roles of agents or persons, which correspond to the ""Person"" class in your GBO ontology. It would be worthwhile to explore these elements further to understand their definitions and how they interrelate within the GMO ontology, especially if you're looking to align or integrate these ontologies. ","The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns.
We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7).
The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified.
The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person.
In Figure 6.1, a few properties are depicted using a dotted-dashed line (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy) to indicate that their domain and range restrictions are not fully imposed.

what objects in the gmo can complete this complex rule? list them","To find objects in the GMO ontology that can complete the complex rule outlined and align with the GBO's Person class as described, we need to identify the elements in the GMO that correspond to the components mentioned in your description. Specifically, we're looking for alignments or equivalences related to:

Person and Agent, including the aspect that every person is an agent and the alignment with Agent and Agent Role patterns.
Attributes and Roles: Including non-permanent/time-dependent attributes (e.g., names, credentials) and roles (e.g., BornPersonRole), and how they are modeled through classes like PersonalInfoItem, Credential, and AgentRole.
BirthEvent: How the birth of a person is modeled, ensuring a person has a birthday and birthplace, and the alignment with the Event pattern.
Properties: Such as hasPersonalInfoItem, hasCredential, hasBirthEvent, occursAtPlace, occursAtTime, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, and performsAgentRole.
Given the complexities of these requirements, we'll search for corresponding classes and properties in the GMO ontology content that match these descriptions. Let's identify the relevant GMO components that could fulfill this complex rule.
Based on the information extracted from the GMO ontology, here are the objects and their relationships that appear to align with the detailed description related to the Person class in GBO:

Class Alignments:
agentrole:Person: Identified as an owl:Class, which is likely the direct correspondence to gbo:Person. This class aligns with the concept of an individual who is an agent.
Property Alignments:
agentrole:hasPersonName: An owl:ObjectProperty that seems to correspond to managing personal information, akin to the hasPersonalInfoItem property.
agentrole:performsAgentRole: Identified as an owl:ObjectProperty, aligning with the concept of performing an agent role, which may relate to the performsAgentRole property description.
agentrole:providesAgentRole: This property could align with both the providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy aspects, considering its mention in the context of agent roles.
agentrole:occursAtPlace: This seems to correspond to the occursAtPlace property, indicating where an event (e.g., BirthEvent) occurs.
Event and Role Related:
The mentions of AgentRole and properties related to event occurrences (occursAtTime, occursAtPlace) suggest a structure to model events like BirthEvent and roles such as AgentRole and BornPersonRole.
Additional Classes and Properties:
agentrole:Place: Directly mentioned, likely aligning with the concept of Place.
Other properties like hasCredential, hasBirthEvent, which are not explicitly found in the provided snippets, might still exist within the full ontology or be indirectly related through the identified properties and classes.
These alignments indicate that the GMO ontology contains detailed modeling of persons, their roles, attributes, and events, closely mirroring the structure and concepts described for the Person in GBO. Specifically, the agentrole:Person class along with properties like agentrole:hasPersonName, agentrole:performsAgentRole, and agentrole:providesAgentRole, among others, form a complex web of relationships that underpin the ontology's representation of individuals and their interactions within a broader context.

This ontology design, which incorporates non-permanent attributes, roles, and events into the modeling of persons, aligns well with the notion that while certain aspects of a person (e.g., name, credentials) may change over time, others (e.g., birthplace, birth event) remain constant. ​",TRUE,1/1,1,4/5,0.2,offers more instances than one,,4/5,0.2,,,,,

The GMO ontology begins with a set of prefix declarations, which is standard for RDF and OWL ontologies. These prefixes are used to define short-hand notations for frequently used URIs, making the ontology easier to read and write. Given the prefixes and the initial structure, I will now search the contents of the GMO ontology for elements related to ""Person"" and ""hasAffiliation"" as described in the GBO ontology.

ChatGPT
To translate the rule gbo:Person(x) ∧ gbo:hasAffiliation(x, z) ↔ gmo:? into a matching or equivalent structure within the GMO ontology, we first need to understand the components of the rule and how they relate to the elements described in the GMO ontology, based on the information you've provided.

Given the detailed description of the Person class in the GMO ontology and its alignment with the concepts of Agent and AgentRole, including attributes such as name, address (modeled as PersonalInfoItem), and credentials (Credential class), along with the BirthEvent, we can deduce a complex representation of a person and their attributes and affiliations within the GMO context.

In the GBO ontology, hasAffiliation suggests a relationship between a person and an organization or entity they are affiliated with. If we are looking for an equivalent or related concept in GMO that would fit the gmo:? part of your rule, we need to consider how affiliations, roles, and relationships between individuals and organizations are represented.

From the information provided about the GMO ontology, relevant classes and properties that could be involved in modeling the affiliation relationship (similar to gbo:hasAffiliation) include:

Person: Clearly defined in both ontologies, representing an individual.
OrganizationAffiliationRole or PersonAffiliationRole: These could represent the affiliation relationship in GMO. An affiliation role might connect a person to an organization through a specific context or position.
AgentAffiliationRole: Given that every person is an agent, this role might also serve as a bridge in the affiliation relationship.
hasSubOrganization, isDescribedBy, isPerformedBy, providesAgentRole: Object properties that could relate to how affiliations are described, though not directly mapping to hasAffiliation without more context.
Organization: The target of an affiliation, representing the entity a person is affiliated with.
Considering the goal to find a complex rule equivalent in the GMO ontology, we're looking for a structure where a person (Person) is connected through some form of affiliation role (possibly one of the specific affiliation roles like OrganizationAffiliationRole or PersonAffiliationRole) to an organization (Organization). This relationship might be indirectly represented through roles (AgentRole, BornPersonRole) and possibly through events or attributes (BirthEvent, PersonalInfoItem, Credential) that contribute to defining the person's status or identity within the affiliation.

Based on this understanding, the most relevant GMO objects that could complete the given rule, considering the description and ontology structure provided, might be:

Person linked to an Organization through an AgentAffiliationRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole, or PersonAffiliationRole.
Properties like isPerformedBy or providesAgentRole could be involved in defining the nature of this affiliation, depending on how the ontology models the dynamic aspects of roles and affiliations.
Without the exact details of how these elements are connected in GMO, this interpretation aligns with the general description and aim of modeling person entities and their relationships within an organizational context.

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find related pieces in the GMO ontology that correspond to the given parts in the GBO ontology, I'll need to examine the contents of the GMO ontology file you uploaded. I'll start by checking the ontology for classes or properties that might be similar or related to Person and isAffiliationOf in the context of their definitions in GBO. This could include similar classes, properties, or any relevant semantic relationships.

Let's start by looking into the GMO ontology file to identify relevant parts.
The GMO ontology starts with a series of namespace prefixes, similar to the GBO ontology you've provided. To identify pieces in GMO related to Person and isAffiliationOf in GBO, I'll search the ontology for:

Classes similar to Person which might involve concepts like humans, agents, or entities with a significant role.
Object properties similar to isAffiliationOf which could involve relationships between agents and organizations or entities.
Let's proceed to search for these related components in the GMO ontology. ​​
In the GMO ontology, there are several components related to the Person class and the isAffiliationOf property from the GBO ontology:

Related to Person:
http://gmo#Agent: Possibly a broader concept that includes individuals or entities capable of actions.
http://gmo#Person: Directly matches the class provided in GBO, indicating a similar concept of a human individual.
http://gmo#PersonName, http://gmo#PersonalInfoItem, and http://gmo#hasPersonName: These seem to be related to personal information or attributes specific to a person.
http://gmo#hasValue, http://gmo#hasLiteralValue, and http://gmo#hasPersonalInfoItem: Properties that might be used to describe attributes or relationships of a person.
Related to isAffiliationOf:
http://gmo#AffiliationRole: This could represent the role or position a person holds within an affiliation, suggesting a concept related to the isAffiliationOf property in GBO.
The identified URIs prefixed with nf8cebe5... appear to be generated nodes or artifacts from the RDF parsing and may not represent actual ontology concepts.

These connections suggest conceptual overlaps, particularly with the notion of individuals (Person) and their affiliations or roles (AffiliationRole). This alignment could facilitate integrating or comparing data between the GMO and GBO ontologies, especially regarding individuals and their organizational roles or affiliations.","The Person pattern, depicted in Figure 6.1, describes a person. In our modeling here, the person entity is represented via the Person class. Every person is an agent. Thus, we align Person with Agent from the Agent and Agent Role patterns (Chapter 1 and 2), as well as the Person pattern’s AgentRole with that of Agent and Agent Role patterns.
We noticed that many attributes of Person are not permanent: even a person’s name may change during his lifetime. The only thing that arguably never changes is birthday and birthplace. Note that the day/time a person dies also does not change, but for a living person, this information is always unknown. To incor- porate the non-permanent/time-dependent attributes, a person may have some credentials, represented by the Credential class, and some personal information items, represented by the PersonalInfoItem class. The latter is used to model attributes such as name, address, etc. We also define an alignment to the Personal Info Item pattern (Chapter 7).
The birth of a person is modeled through BirthEvent. We assert that a person must have a birthday and a birthplace. The birth event itself provides a role performed by the person, represented by BornPersonRole, which is a particular kind of agent-role. As birth-event is a type of event, we define an alignment with the Event pattern (Chapter 3). Here, BirthEvent, BornPersonRole, and Person in the Person pattern are re- sepectively aligned to Event, AgentRole, and Agent in the Event pattern. In addition, the latter two are also aligned to AgentRole and Agent of the Agent Role pattern. Alignments to the Place pattern and the OWL Time ontology are also specified.
The BirthEvent itself is defined such that it provides exactly one agent-role that is an instance of type BornPersonRole and this agent-role is performed by the person.

Analyzed Concepts and Relationships:
Person: Represented in both GBO and GMO, aligned with Agent.
Personal Info Items and Credentials: Reflect time-dependent attributes of a person.
BirthEvent and Related Concepts: Model birth-specific information, linking to Person through BornPersonRole.
Affiliations: Related to roles a person can have, potentially connecting to organizations or events.
Given these points, the complex rule seems to involve not just a Person and their affiliation (isAffiliationOf), but also potentially their roles (AgentRole, BornPersonRole, PersonAffiliationRole), events related to them (BirthEvent), and organizations they are affiliated with (AgentAffiliationRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole).

The elements gbo:Person(x) and gbo:isAffiliationOf(x, z) suggest we are looking for entities in GMO that represent a person and their affiliations or roles within organizations or events. Considering the alignment with concepts such as AgentRole, Agent, PersonAffiliationRole, and the properties that connect these roles or affiliations (providesAgentRole, performsAgentRole), we should focus on similar connections in GMO.

Let's list the GMO objects that might complete this rule based on the mentioned ontology patterns and relationships:

Person (Class): Directly mentioned, aligns with Agent.
AgentRole (Class): Might be involved in defining the type of role a person holds.
PersonalInfoItem (Class): Related through attributes of a person, though more indirect.
Credential (Class): Indicates qualifications or affiliations, again more indirect.
OrganizationAffiliationRole, PersonAffiliationRole (Classes): Specific roles related to affiliations.
providesAgentRole, performsAgentRole (ObjectProperties): Indicate the role a person has within an affiliation.
These components within GMO could logically complete the rule involving gbo:Person(x) and gbo:isAffiliationOf(x, z) by mapping persons to their roles and affiliations within the ontology's conceptual framework. The direct and most relevant mappings would likely involve Person, AgentRole, OrganizationAffiliationRole, and PersonAffiliationRole, along with the properties that connect these roles (providesAgentRole, performsAgentRole).

This could mean that the specific terms ""Person rdf:type owl:Class"" and ""hasFullName rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty"" you're asking about may not be directly mentioned in the GMO ontology in a way that matches the GBO ontology descriptions you provided.
To assist you further, I can manually examine the ""gmo.ttl"" file to identify elements that might correspond to the concepts of ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"" from the GBO ontology. This process involves looking for classes or properties in the GMO ontology that serve similar purposes or have similar names to what you've described from the GBO ontology.
Let's proceed with manually examining the ""gmo.ttl"" file for any related parts.
The ""gmo.ttl"" file begins with a series of namespace prefixes that are common in RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies. These prefixes define shorthand notations for longer URIs, making the ontology easier to read and write.
Given the structure of the file and the namespaces defined at the beginning, I will now search the content of the ""gmo.ttl"" file for elements that might correspond to the ""Person"" class and the ""hasFullName"" property as described in your GBO ontology.
I'll look for classes or properties related to individuals (that could correspond to ""Person"") and naming (that could correspond to ""hasFullName""). Let's proceed with this targeted search. ​​
Based on the examination of the ""gmo.ttl"" file, here are the findings related to the concepts similar to ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"" from the GBO ontology:
Person-related Concepts in GMO:
Agent Role: Various properties and classes related to the role of an agent, including agentrole:Agent, agentrole:AgentRole, and agentrole:PersonName, suggest a focus on individuals and their roles within the GMO ontology.
Person Name: The property agentrole:hasPersonName and the class agentrole:PersonName are directly related to naming individuals, which could be analogous to the ""hasFullName"" property in the GBO ontology.
hasFullName-related Concepts in GMO:
Naming Information: The GMO ontology contains several properties related to personal naming information, such as agentrole:familyOrSurname, agentrole:firstOrGivenName, and agentrole:fullName. These are part of the personal information items and closely align with the concept of ""hasFullName"" from the GBO ontology.
Reihan: semantic similarity to parts of the ontology.
These elements indicate that the GMO ontology includes detailed concepts for representing individuals and their naming information, similar to the ""Person"" class and ""hasFullName"" property in the GBO ontology. The agentrole:Agent, agentrole:AgentRole, and agentrole:PersonName classes, along with properties for various components of a person's name, provide a rich structure for representing personal information within the GMO ontology. ​​
","more information about GMO:
The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

Based on the detailed description of the Personal Info Item pattern in the GMO ontology and the alignment information provided, we can make a conceptual alignment between the entities described in the GBO ontology and their counterparts in the GMO ontology. Here's how the concepts from GBO might map to the corresponding concepts in GMO:

GBO to GMO Alignment
GBO Person to GMO Person:
The GBO concept of a Person can be directly aligned with the Person class in the GMO ontology. In GMO, a Person is likely represented as an individual with various time-dependent attributes encapsulated by the Personal Info Item pattern. This aligns well with the GBO's notion of a Person as ""a homo sapien Agent of some significance.""
GBO hasFullName to GMO Personal Info Item Pattern:
The GBO property hasFullName, which is a datatype property that associates a Person with their full name, can be aligned with the Personal Info Item pattern in GMO. Specifically, it can be related to the use of hasValue or hasLiteralValue properties within the GMO to represent the full name of a person as a personal information item. In GMO, the full name might be considered a type of personal information that starts and ends at specific instants in time, encapsulating the time-dependent nature of such information.
Specific Alignment Proposal:
Given the structures described, the alignment from GBO to GMO, specifically for the pattern involving a person and their full name, could be expressed in a pseudo-SPARQL or logical form as follows Person(x) ∧ hasFullName(x, z) → 
ecglpr:Person(x) ∧ ecglpi:PersonalInfoItem(y) ∧ 
ecglpi:hasValue(y, z) ∨ ecglpi:hasLiteralValue(y, z) ∧ 
ecglpr:hasPersonalInfoItem(x, y)
This alignment assumes that:

x is an individual of the class Person.
y represents an instance of the PersonalInfoItem, specifically relating to the full name.
z is the literal value representing the full name of the person.
The use of ecglpi:hasValue or ecglpi:hasLiteralValue to associate the personal information item (y) with its actual value (z), which in this case is the full name.
The ecglpr:hasPersonalInfoItem property links the person (x) to their personal information item (y), ensuring that the relationship between a person and their full name is maintained as per the GMO ontology's Personal Info Item pattern.
This conceptual alignment provides a way to translate or connect the information regarding individuals and their full names from GBO to the relevant constructs in GMO, leveraging the Personal Info Item pattern for representing time-dependent personal information.",FALSE,4/4,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

","Given the detailed description of the Personal Info Item pattern in the GMO ontology and the alignments with the Person pattern, it's clear that the ontology is structured to encapsulate personal information of individuals in a temporally aware manner. This detailed structure includes the handling of personal information items like names, addresses, and nationality, each with a starting and ending time point, and the ability to link personal information items to persons using specific properties.
The description also highlights a system for managing personal information values, whether as simple literals or as part of a controlled vocabulary, with the flexibility for specialization and extension in handling different types of personal information.
Related Parts in GMO to GBO's ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"":
Given this additional context, let's refine our search within the GMO ontology for elements that:
Align with the concept of a ""Person"" as an individual with significant attributes (e.g., name, address, nationality) that are temporally bound.
Relate to the handling of a person's full name, including the representation of names with multiple components (given name, surname, full name) and the management of these through specific properties.
Specifically, we'll look for:
Classes and properties related to ""Person"" and ""PersonalInfoItem"" that reflect the detailed structure and temporal awareness described.
The usage of properties like ""hasValue"" or ""hasLiteralValue"" that associate personal information items with their actual values, which would be relevant to the representation of a person's full name.
Additionally, the alignments mentioned:
Prefixes ecglpi and ecglpr suggest an external alignment or integration with other ontologies or standards, pointing towards a broader interoperability in how personal information is managed.
The mention of object properties like ecglpi:hasPersonalInfoItem and ecglpr:hasPersonalInfoItem, alongside the classes Person and PersonalInfoItem under both prefixes, indicates an emphasis on linking personal information items directly to individuals.
Let's use this refined understanding to identify relevant parts in the GMO ontology that align with the ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"" concepts from the GBO ontology.
Based on the refined search within the GMO ontology, here are the elements related to the concepts of ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"" from the GBO ontology, considering the detailed description of the Personal Info Item pattern:
Person-related Elements in GMO:
Person Class: Defined as agentrole:Person, this class represents individuals within the GMO ontology, aligning with the concept of ""Person"" in the GBO ontology.
PersonalInfoItem Class: Identified as agentrole:PersonalInfoItem, this class encapsulates time-dependent attributes of a person, such as names, addresses, and nationality, providing a structure for personal information that is temporally bound.
hasPersonalInfoItem Property: This object property (agentrole:hasPersonalInfoItem) links a person to their personal information items, reflecting the inverse relationship specified between personal information items and individuals.
Name-related Elements in GMO:
hasPersonName Property: The agentrole:hasPersonName object property associates a person with their name, akin to the ""hasFullName"" concept in GBO.
PersonName Class: The class agentrole:PersonName is a specialization under PersonalInfoItem, designed to represent a person's name within the ontology.
fullName Property: The agentrole:fullName datatype property is used to capture the full name of a person as a simple literal string, directly corresponding to the ""hasFullName"" property in the GBO ontology.
These elements highlight the GMO ontology's approach to managing personal information, with a focus on temporal aspects and the detailed representation of personal attributes like names. The structure allows for the encapsulation of personal information, including names, in a way that aligns with the temporal and detailed nature of personal information management described in your detailed overview.
This analysis shows a clear correspondence between the GBO ontology's ""Person"" and ""hasFullName"" concepts and the GMO ontology's handling of personal information, particularly regarding individuals and their names                
Person(x) ∧ hasFullName(x, z) in GBO maps to agentrole:Person(x) ∧ agentrole:hasPersonName(x, y) ∧ agentrole:fullName(y, z) in GMO.

Let's proceed with this analysis. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like we're encountering an issue analyzing the GMO ontology file directly in this environment. This might be due to limitations in handling ontology files directly or specific content in the file that's not being processed as expected.

Given these constraints, I can provide guidance on how you might approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology components you mentioned. Here's a general strategy you can apply using ontology editing tools or programming libraries designed for semantic web technologies (such as RDFlib in Python):

Load both Ontologies: Use an ontology editor (like Protégé) or a library (like RDFlib for Python) to load both your GMO and GBO ontologies.
Identify Key Concepts and Properties in GBO: You've already identified Person and hasGivenName as key parts of GBO.
Search for Equivalent or Similar Concepts in GMO:
For the Person class, look for classes in GMO that represent individuals, humans, or agents. Equivalence might be direct (e.g., a Human or Agent class) or require interpretation (e.g., a Member class that implies personhood).
For the hasGivenName property, search for properties related to names in GMO. This might include properties explicitly about names (givenName, firstName) or more generally about identifying information (identifier, label).
Use Semantic Relationships to Find Connections: If direct matches aren't found, explore semantic relationships. For example, properties or classes in GMO related to personal identification, familial relationships, or descriptive attributes might indirectly relate to Person and hasGivenName.
Leverage Ontology Reasoning Tools: Some tools can infer relationships or suggest equivalences between different ontology elements based on their definitions and the ontology's overall structure.
Consult Documentation or Domain Experts: If GMO has accompanying documentation or if there are domain experts available, their insights could be invaluable in identifying related concepts.
This approach requires a bit of manual investigation and interpretation, especially when direct equivalents aren't obvious. If you're able to use specific tools or libraries and encounter technical challenges, I'd be happy to provide more direct assistance with those. ​","more information about GMO:
The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

can you align gbo to gmo as below?  GBO → GMO

","Based on the detailed information you provided about the GMO ontology and its focus on personal information items and the temporal aspects of such attributes, we can attempt to align the GBO concepts of Person and hasGivenName to similar concepts in GMO.

Given the description, the GMO ontology uses a pattern for representing personal information that is more detailed and structured than what might be directly inferred from the simple structure of GBO. The PersonalInfoItem concept in GMO seems particularly relevant, as it encapsulates time-dependent attributes of a person, such as names, addresses, and nationalities, and is associated with a Person through specific properties. This is more granular than the typical use of direct properties like hasGivenName in GBO.

Alignment of http://gbo#Person to GMO:
In GBO, a Person is simply an individual of significance, without an explicit temporal component to their attributes. In GMO, a Person is likely represented similarly (under ecglpr:Person), but the attributes of a person, such as names, are encapsulated in PersonalInfoItem instances, which do have temporal aspects.

GBO Person to GMO:
GBO Person can be directly aligned with GMO ecglpr:Person for the concept of an individual.
The attributes of a GBO Person, like a given name, align with GMO's PersonalInfoItem, specifically instances of PersonalInfoItem that represent name information.
Alignment of http://gbo#hasGivenName to GMO:
In GBO, hasGivenName directly relates a Person to a string representing their given name.

GBO hasGivenName to GMO:
This is less directly aligned due to GMO's structure. Instead, a Person in GMO would be associated with a PersonalInfoItem that represents the given name attribute. This PersonalInfoItem would then use either hasValue or hasLiteralValue to associate with the actual given name string.
The direct property in GBO (hasGivenName) aligns with a more complex structure in GMO, involving a Person, a PersonalInfoItem, and the item's value properties.
Logical Alignment Example (GBO → GMO):
For a logical alignment based on the example you've provided:

GBO: Person(x) ∧ hasGivenName(x, z) → GMO:
Step 1: ecglpr:Person(x) in GMO to identify the individual.
Step 2: Create or identify a PersonalInfoItem(y) associated with x through ecglpr:hasPersonalInfoItem or its inverse, where y represents a given name.
Step 3: The given name's value is associated with y through y hasValue z or y hasLiteralValue z, where z is the given name string.
This alignment suggests a transformation from a direct property association in GBO to a more structured, temporally aware representation in GMO, involving intermediary PersonalInfoItem instances to encapsulate the attribute's temporal aspects.

Given the abstract nature of this alignment and without direct access to manipulate the ontologies, the specific implementation would require creating instances of PersonalInfoItem in GMO for each name-related attribute in GBO and properly linking these items to their respective Person instances, while considering the temporal aspects GMO emphasizes.",FALSE,4/4,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

The Person Name pattern is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing a person’s name. We are aware that names and their usages are very culturally dependent. Making a versatile pattern for person names which is applicable in a multitude of cultural, national, and legislative contexts is a formidable challenge in its own right, and we consider this out of scope for our current purposes. In this sense, our person name pattern is a stub pattern, i.e. it is not fully developed. The intended usage is that fullNameAsString points to the full official name of the person, transcribed to latin letters, while firstOrGivenName and familyOrSurname point to the corresponding two parts of the name as that person would usually give them. While this is not a satisfactory solution for many contexts, it will serve our purpose for now – and we understand that a more sophisticated solution, which is out of scope for us at this stage, would be preferable.

Person(x) ∧ hasGivenName(x, z) → ?","Based on the detailed information about the GMO ontology and the request to align the GBO ontology's Person class and hasGivenName property to the GMO, here's how the alignment could be conceptualized:

In GBO, you have:

Person(x) representing an individual.
hasGivenName(x, z) indicating that a person x has a given name z.
In GMO, from the description provided:

The Person class exists with a similar concept, possibly represented as ecglpr:Person (from the personal info item pattern).
Names and personal information are handled through the Personal Info Item pattern, with PersonName as a specialization for names.
The PersonName pattern includes properties for the full name (fullNameAsString), given name (firstOrGivenName), and surname (familyOrSurname).
Given this, the alignment from GBO to GMO could be as follows:

For Person(x) in GBO, it directly aligns with ecglpr:Person in GMO as both represent individuals.
For hasGivenName(x, z) in GBO, this property aligns with firstOrGivenName in GMO, indicating the given name of a person.
Therefore, the GBO to GMO alignment could be expressed as:

GBO's Person(x) → GMO's ecglpr:Person: This alignment is straightforward since both ontologies seem to use Person to represent individuals.
GBO's hasGivenName(x, z) → GMO's firstOrGivenName in the context of a PersonName personal info item: Here, the given name z for a person x in GBO is mapped to the firstOrGivenName property of a PersonName object, which is associated with a Person in GMO. The relationship between a Person and their name in GMO is managed via the personal info item pattern, likely involving the hasPersonalInfoItem property to link Person to PersonName, where PersonName would use firstOrGivenName to store the given name.
The logical representation of the alignment could be something like this:

For any individual x with a given name z in GBO (Person(x) ∧ hasGivenName(x, z)), there exists a Person in GMO (ecglpr:Person) and a PersonName (ecglpi:PersonName) such that Person is linked to PersonName through ecglpi:hasPersonalInfoItem or ecglpr:hasPersonalInfoItem, and PersonName has a firstOrGivenName property with the value z.

Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering an unexpected issue accessing the file you uploaded. This prevents me from directly inspecting or processing the GMO ontology.

Despite this, we can still discuss the general approach to finding related pieces in one ontology based on another. Identifying related components between two ontologies, like GMO and GBO in your case, typically involves comparing their classes, properties, and instances, focusing on similarities in their names, labels, comments, or the structure of the ontology itself.

For your specific request, we would look for classes and properties in the GMO ontology that match or relate to the Person class and the hasFamilyName property in the GBO ontology. This could include direct equivalents or more broadly related concepts, depending on the specific structure and content of the GMO ontology.

The intended usage is that fullNameAsString points to the full official name of the person, transcribed to latin letters, while firstOrGivenName and familyOrSurname point to the corresponding two parts of the name as that person would usually give them. While this is not a satisfactory solution for many contexts, it will serve our purpose for now – and we understand that a more sophisticated solution, which is out of scope for us at this stage, would be preferable.

GBO to GMO Alignment Proposal
GBO's Person Class

GBO: Person is defined as a class of significant homo sapien agents, without explicit mention of temporal attributes or the detailed structure of personal information.
GMO: The Person class aligns with ecglpr:Person (assuming ecglpr is the prefix denoting the namespace for person-related concepts in GMO). GMO's Person class is part of a broader model that includes temporal aspects of personal information, which are not explicitly modeled in the GBO snippet provided.
GBO's hasFamilyName Property

GBO: hasFamilyName is a datatype property with the domain of Person and range of xsd:string, indicating the family name of a person.
GMO: The equivalent in GMO would likely be the familyOrSurname data property within the context of a PersonName personal information item. This property is part of the Person Name pattern, which is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing names.
Alignment Expression
Given the descriptions, the alignment from GBO's Person and hasFamilyName to GMO could be represented as follows:

GBO: Person(x) ∧ hasFamilyName(x, z)
GMO: ecglpr:Person(x) ∧ ecglpi:PersonName(y) ∧ hasPersonalInfoItem(x, y) ∧ familyOrSurname(y, z)
This alignment assumes:

x is an instance of a Person.
z is the family name of the person.
y represents a PersonName instance associated with x through the hasPersonalInfoItem property in GMO, which encapsulates the family name through familyOrSurname.
This approach aligns the core concept of a person having a family name from GBO to a more detailed representation in GMO, which includes the temporal and structured modeling of personal information. However, this is a high-level conceptual alignment and might need adjustments based on the complete definitions and constraints of both ontologies.",TRUE,3/4,0.75,0,1,detects deferent variation as next row,,0,1,,,,,

First, I'll check the format and content of the GMO ontology to ensure it's correctly formatted and there are no errors preventing its parsing. Let's start by inspecting the beginning of the file to understand its structure and identify any potential issues. ​​
Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering an unexpected issue accessing the file you uploaded. This prevents me from directly inspecting or processing the GMO ontology.

Despite this, we can still discuss the general approach to finding related pieces in one ontology based on another. Identifying related components between two ontologies, like GMO and GBO in your case, typically involves comparing their classes, properties, and instances, focusing on similarities in their names, labels, comments, or the structure of the ontology itself.

For your specific request, we would look for classes and properties in the GMO ontology that match or relate to the Person class and the hasFamilyName property in the GBO ontology. This could include direct equivalents or more broadly related concepts, depending on the specific structure and content of the GMO ontology.

If you're able to resolve the file access issue on your side or provide more details about the GMO ontology, I could give you more targeted advice. Alternatively, if you have specific questions about ontology alignment or comparison techniques, I'm here to help with that too","More information about GMO:
The Personal Info Item pattern encapsulates any time-dependent attribute of a Person, for example, name, address, nationality, etc. A PersonalInfoItem starts at exactly one time:Instant and also ends at exactly one time:Instant. Currently, a correct temporal ordering is not enforced by this pattern. A PersonalInfoItem is a personal info item of exactly one Person and the alignment with the hasPersonalInfoItem property from the Person pattern is specified as the inverse of this relationship.
Each personal information item is typically associated with some value that represents the actual per- sonal information. Such a personal information value depends on the type of personal information being presented. For example, a simple literal string may be enough for email address, while for a person’s name, we may need three different literal strings to represent given name, surname, and the full name as it is cus- tomarily written. Such a value may also be represented with some controlled vocabulary terms, e.g., to model nationality, we may want to borrow a set of country names from an established standard. In this pattern stub, we provide one object property (hasValue) and one data property (hasLiteralValue) to associate the personal information item with its actual value. This is, however, done with an understanding that a specialization of this pattern will introduce its own properties that specifically deal with the actual per- sonal information value. Therefore, this pattern stub does not enforce that a personal information item has to have either a value or a literal value. In addition, a specialization of this pattern stub may also include some constraints on the range of personal information values allowed for it. We refer the reader to Chapter 8 for a concrete specialization of this pattern stub.

The Person Name pattern is a specialization of the Personal Info Item pattern for describing a person’s name. We are aware that names and their usages are very culturally dependent. Making a versatile pattern for person names which is applicable in a multitude of cultural, national, and legislative contexts is a formidable challenge in its own right, and we consider this out of scope for our current purposes. In this sense, our person name pattern is a stub pattern, i.e. it is not fully developed.

The information you provided hints at a structure where platforms are described by information objects and the ontological design enforces specific constraints and relationships involving platforms and information objects. Here’s how we can map or relate these to your initial query about gbo#Platform:

Platform Description and Relationship: Both ontologies seem to use a similar concept where a Platform is described by an InformationObject. This indicates a pattern where platforms, possibly varying in nature (like vessels, buoys, satellites, etc.), are linked to data (metadata, descriptions, capabilities) through an isDescribedBy relationship. In GMO, if there's a similar object property linking platforms to information objects, it would directly relate to the GBO description of Platform.
Specific Constraints: The constraints you've described:
Platform ⊑ (=1 isDescribedBy.InformationObject) suggests that each platform is described by exactly one information object.
Platform ⊑ ∃isDescribedBy.InformationObject indicates that platforms must be described by at least one information object.
Platform ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject implies all descriptions linked to a platform must be information objects.
The class disjointness axiom (Platform ⊓ InformationObject ⊑ ⊥) ensures that no individual can be both a Platform and an InformationObject, maintaining a clear separation between these entities.
Class and Object Property Similarities:
The mention of Platform and InformationObject classes in both ecglpf: (presumably related to platforms) and ecglvs: (related to vessels) namespaces indicates a structured approach to categorizing physical objects and their descriptive metadata.
The isDescribedBy object property is central to linking platforms to their descriptions, mirroring the relationship you’re interested in from the GBO ontology.
Prefix and Namespace Details:
The prefixes ecglpf: and ecglvs: suggest that the GMO ontology might have specialized namespaces for dealing with platform and vessel information separately but within a coherent framework.
Given this structure, the related pieces in GMO that would be similar to gbo#Platform involve:

The Platform class itself, especially if it's used in a similar context of categorizing various types of physical observation platforms.
The isDescribedBy object property, particularly how it's used to link platforms to their descriptive information objects.
The InformationObject class, as it seems crucial for describing platforms.
Any specific instances or subclasses of Platform that follow the SeaVoX L06 platform categories, if such categorization is directly used or adapted within the GMO ontology.
Without directly querying your GMO ontology file (due to the previous issue encountered), this analysis is based on the ontological structure and relationships you've described. If there are specific elements, classes, or relationships you'd like to explore further in the context of GMO, providing more details or adjusting the focus of your inquiry might help in identifying more precise connections.",FALSE,1/1,1,1/2,0.5,,,1/2,0.5,,,,,

It appears we're encountering an issue with directly querying the GMO ontology for relevant parts related to the GBO's PlatformType. This could be due to various reasons, such as the complexity of the ontology, specific configurations, or limitations in our current environment.

Class: ecglpf:Platform
This class likely represents the general concept of a platform within the GMO ontology, similar to how PlatformType is used in GBO. Given that the description mentions platform types coming from SeaVoX L06 platform categories, it indicates that ecglpf:Platform is a key class for categorizing different types of platforms, such as vessels, gliders, floats, etc.
ObjectProperty: ecglpf:isDescribedBy / ecglvs:isDescribedBy
These properties indicate a relationship where platforms (and potentially vessels) are linked to information objects that describe them. This is somewhat similar to the GBO's use of PlatformType, which might be used to categorize or describe platforms in more detail. The precise nature of these information objects would depend on how they are instantiated in the ontology, potentially including specifications, capabilities, or categories of platforms.
Class: ecglvs:Vessel
This class is specifically for vessels, which are a type of platform. Given that PlatformType in GBO includes various types of platforms including vessels, this class is directly relevant.
Class disjointness axioms:
The axiom stating that Platform and InformationObject are disjoint suggests a clear separation between the concepts of platforms themselves and the informational entities that describe them. This might be akin to separating instances of PlatformType from the actual data or metadata about those platforms in GBO.
Ontology structure regarding platforms and descriptions:
The nomenclature and ontology structure provided imply a systematic approach to categorizing platforms and linking them to descriptive information objects. This aligns with the purpose of PlatformType in GBO, which is to categorize platforms. The isDescribedBy property plays a critical role in linking platform instances to their descriptions, which could include classification according to the SeaVoX L06 platform categories or other descriptive information.
In summary, the ecglpf:Platform class, alongside the isDescribedBy properties and the specific ecglvs:Vessel class, represent parts of the GMO ontology that correlate with the concept of PlatformType in GBO. These elements form a structure for categorizing and describing platforms in a manner that appears similar to the purpose and use of PlatformType ",TRUE,0/1,0,3/3,0, subClass(),,3/3,0,,,,,

However, we can still discuss and explore the concepts you're interested in regarding ontology alignment or finding relationships between the concepts in the two ontologies, GBO and GMO.

Typically, to find related parts between two ontologies like GBO and GMO, we look for similar classes, properties, or instances that might serve analogous purposes or have overlapping semantic meanings. For the pieces you mentioned from GBO:

Class Platform: We would look for a class in GMO that represents physical objects or entities used for observations or data collection. This could involve searching for classes with similar labels, comments, or properties.
ObjectProperty hasOwner: We would search for a property in GMO that denotes ownership or a similar relationship between entities, especially with a domain that could include platforms or equivalent entities and a range that involves organizations or individuals.

Here's a breakdown of the related pieces in GMO that align with your description:

GMO Platform and Vessel as Platform Types:
In GMO, platforms are categorized primarily by the types listed in the SeaVoX L06 platform categories, which is similar to the definition of gbo:Platform. The ecglpf:Platform class in GMO aligns with this concept, as it is used to represent various types of platforms, including vessels.
The ecglvs:Vessel class is specifically mentioned as a type of platform, aligning it closely with the gbo:Platform concept. Vessels are considered platforms on which cruises are carried out, and they can be described by observable physical properties. This makes the ecglvs:Vessel class a direct counterpart to gbo:Platform in the context of vessels.
Ownership and Affiliation with Organizations:
Although the direct property gbo:hasOwner does not have a named equivalent mentioned in the provided GMO snippet, the concept of vessels having an owner or being affiliated with an organization is captured. This is modeled using the Agent Role pattern, suggesting that there are properties or relationships within GMO that denote ownership or affiliation, similar to gbo:hasOwner.
The relationship or property that models this concept might not be explicitly named in the provided text, but the indication that vessels (a type of platform) have owners aligns with the semantic intent of gbo:hasOwner.
Description and InformationObject Alignment:
The ecglvs:isDescribedBy and ecglpf:isDescribedBy object properties in GMO suggest a mechanism for linking platforms (and vessels, by extension) to descriptive information objects. This is analogous to the idea behind gbo:Platform being associated with various attributes or entities, potentially including ownership details.
The class ecglvs:InformationObject and its alignment with platforms through the isDescribedBy property reflect a structured approach to encapsulating information about platforms, including potentially the owner information, in a manner somewhat parallel to the gbo:hasOwner construct.
In summary, while the specific property gbo:hasOwner does not have a directly named counterpart in the provided GMO details, the concepts of platforms being associated with vessels (ecglvs:Vessel as a specific type of ecglpf:Platform) and the mention of agent roles (implying ownership or organizational affiliation) indicate a conceptual alignment. The use of isDescribedBy properties to link platforms to informational objects further aligns with the idea of platforms having associated descriptive details, which could include ownership.",TRUE,1/4,0.25,2/3,0.3333333333,not enough module info,,2/3,0.3333333333,,,,,

Platform Class: The GMO ontology appears to have a direct counterpart to the GBO's ""Platform"" class. The GMO ontology discusses platforms in the context of vessels and observational equipment, aligning closely with the description of ""Platform"" in the GBO ontology as a physical object enabling observations.
Vessel as a Platform Type: In GMO, vessels are explicitly considered a type of platform, which suggests that any relations or properties applied to ""Platform"" could potentially be applicable to vessels. This is a direct parallel to the ""Platform"" concept in GBO.
Ownership and Affiliation: The GMO ontology mentions that vessels (a type of platform) likely have an owner or are affiliated with an organization, modeled using the Agent Role pattern. This is conceptually similar to the ""isOwnerOf"" property in GBO, indicating ownership or affiliation between an agent (e.g., an organization or individual) and a platform.
Descriptive Information: The GMO ontology utilizes the ""isDescribedBy"" property to link platforms (and vessels) to informational objects, which could include identifiers, names, webpages, and other relevant data. While this doesn't directly correlate to the ""isOwnerOf"" property, it shows how relationships between platforms and other entities or information are modeled in GMO.
Given these elements, the related pieces in the GMO ontology to ""gbo:Platform"" and ""gbo:isOwnerOf"" could be as follows:

Related to gbo:Platform: The ""ecglpf:Platform"" class and potentially the ""ecglvs:Vessel"" class, since vessels are considered a type of platform in GMO.
Related to gbo:isOwnerOf: While the specific property ""isOwnerOf"" is not directly mentioned in the provided GMO details, the concept of ownership or affiliation with an organization is addressed through the context of vessels having owners. This is modeled using the Agent Role pattern, but the exact property name for ownership in GMO is not provided in the information. It might be inferred that a property similar to ""isOwnerOf"" could exist, possibly linking vessels (as platforms) to their owners or affiliated organizations.

It looks like I've encountered an unexpected issue with processing the GMO ontology file, preventing me from directly extracting and comparing the information as intended. While I can't proceed with the analysis in the way I planned, we can still discuss general strategies for comparing ontologies and identifying related concepts across them.

Concept Matching: Identify similar or equivalent classes and properties by comparing their labels, comments, and definitions if available. This involves looking for terms like ""Platform"" and ""PlatformType"" in the GMO ontology and seeing if they have analogous classes or roles.
Property Analysis: Compare the properties in both ontologies by looking at their domains, ranges, and any specified inverse properties. For instance, if GBO has hasPlatformType with a certain domain and range, search for properties in GMO with similar domain-range configurations.
Ontology Structure: Examine the overall structure of the GMO ontology to see how it organizes its concepts and relationships. This might give you clues about where to find related concepts, especially if the ontology uses a hierarchical structure that groups related concepts together.
Semantic Similarity: Tools and methods that measure semantic similarity or relatedness between ontology entities can be useful. These might include machine learning models trained on ontological data or algorithms designed to assess similarity based on the structure of the ontology graph.

The key points from your description include:

Platform Types: Derived from SeaVoX L06 platform categories, indicating a structured approach to categorizing platforms, similar to how PlatformType might be used in GBO to categorize platforms.
Vessel Pattern: Aligns with the Platform pattern, indicating that vessels are considered a type of platform. This is directly analogous to the relationship between platforms and their types in GBO.
Property Value Pattern: Used for modeling observable properties of vessels (which are platforms), such as length and beam. This suggests a structured approach to describing platforms' physical characteristics, similar to how properties in GBO might describe platforms.
Agent Role Pattern: Indicates that vessels (platforms) have associated agent roles, such as owners or affiliated organizations. This shows a concern for the relationships between platforms and agents, which might parallel how platforms in GBO relate to other entities.
Information Object Pattern: Used for providing additional information about vessels, aligning platforms with information objects. This suggests a mechanism for describing platforms with metadata, akin to how platforms might be described in GBO.

ObjectProperty: ecglvs:isDescribedBy and ecglpf:isDescribedBy might be similar in their role to hasPlatformType in the sense that they describe relationships between entities (platforms/vessels and information objects). However, they are more about description rather than categorization.
Classes: ecglpf:Platform and ecglvs:Vessel could be seen as analogous to the GBO Platform class, with Vessel being a specific instance of a platform type. There doesn't seem to be a direct analog to PlatformType unless platform types are implicitly covered by the categorization within the ontology (e.g., different classes or subclasses representing different types of platforms).
Patterns and Properties: The description suggests a rich modeling of platforms (and vessels as specific platforms), including their properties and relations to other entities (agents, information objects). While not directly mapping to a single property like hasPlatformType, this modeling approach reflects a similar concern for detailing the nature and categorization of platforms.
In summary, the GMO ontology seems to focus on detailed modeling of platforms (including vessels as specific types of platforms) and their properties and relationships, with an emphasis on descriptive rather than categorical relationships like hasPlatformType.

Identify Similar Concepts: Look for object properties in the GMO ontology that serve similar roles or are conceptually similar to isPlatformTypeOf from the GBO ontology. This includes properties that might define relationships between platforms and other entities.
Explore Labels and Descriptions: Examine the labels (rdfs:label) and comments (rdfs:comment) of properties and classes in the GMO ontology. These might provide insights into how they relate to the concept of platform types as described in GBO.
Check Domain and Range: For object properties that seem related, check their domain (rdfs:domain) and range (rdfs:range) definitions. This could help you understand the types of entities that the property connects, which might be analogous to the use of isPlatformTypeOf in GBO.
Analyze Ontology Structure: Consider the overall structure of both ontologies. If they share a similar structure or common upper ontology, there might be a straightforward mapping between the two, including but not limited to the specific property in question.
Manual or Semi-automated Mapping: Based on the above, you might identify potential mappings between GMO and GBO. This could be done manually or with the help of ontology alignment tools that can suggest potential correspondences based on structure, naming, and other factors.

Here’s an interpretation and alignment of concepts:

Platform and Vessel as Types of Entities: In GMO, the concept of a Platform is aligned with the Vessel concept, where a vessel is considered a type of platform. This is very much in line with the idea behind isPlatformTypeOf in GBO, which likely relates different entities to their platform categories or types.
Object Properties for Descriptions: The isDescribedBy property in GMO, which links platforms (and vessels) to InformationObject, serves a purpose similar to providing detailed classifications or descriptions, akin to how isPlatformTypeOf might categorize platforms in GBO. It’s about establishing a relationship between an entity and its descriptive attributes or classifications.
Class Hierarchy and Relationships:
ecglpf:Platform and ecglvs:Vessel are both considered types of platforms, with Vessel explicitly aligned to the Platform pattern. This hierarchical relationship echoes the intent behind isPlatformTypeOf, focusing on categorizing platforms.
The usage of isDescribedBy to connect platforms and vessels to information objects for descriptive purposes mirrors the intent of classification or typing as seen with isPlatformTypeOf.
Integration with Other Patterns:
The integration with the Property Value pattern for modeling physical properties of vessels, and the Agent Role pattern for describing roles associated with agents, can be seen as complementary to the typing provided by isPlatformTypeOf, by further specifying the nature and characteristics of the platforms.
The alignment with the Information Object pattern for including identifiers, names, web pages, and other descriptive information also complements the role of isPlatformTypeOf in providing a framework for classifying and describing platforms.
Disjointness and Specificity:
The mention of class disjointness between Platform and InformationObject underlines the clear categorization and separation of entities and their descriptions, a principle that also underlies specific categorization efforts like isPlatformTypeOf.
From this analysis, while isPlatformTypeOf itself as a direct correlate might not exist in GMO, the patterns of classification, description, and typing of platforms and vessels within GMO resonate with the purposes served by isPlatformTypeOf in GBO. The isDescribedBy relationship and the structured integration with other descriptive and classification patterns in GMO provide a framework that, in spirit, aligns with the goals of isPlatformTypeOf in categorizing and describing platform types",TRUE,0/1,0,0,1,Type(),,0,1,,,,,

Other pieces of information regarding a vessel that may be useful are included through the alignment withthe Information Object pattern. Such information does not only include vessel identifiers, names, and webpage, which can already be accommodated by the original Information Object pattern, but also other information such as year of commission and decommssion, etc.
Nomenclature part of the Vessel pattern includes terms describing properties relevant for a vessel (Fig- ure 15.2) and types of agent-roles provided by a vessel (Figure 15.3). In this part, properties of every vessel includes a length, beam, draft, and displacement. In addition, a vessel provides an owner role. Note that the owner role here is specific for vessels, and this is realized by defining it under Vessel pattern’s URI namespace.
Every vessel has exactly one information object. Also, we assert the guarded domain and range restrictions.

alldisjoint(Vessel, InformationObject, TimeInstant, AgentRole, Agent, Property)","Based on the detailed information provided about the GMO and its representation of vessels, I can help outline which parts of the ontology are likely related to the concept of a ""Vessel"" as described in the context of your project with GBO. The description you've provided gives a thorough insight into how vessels are modeled within the GMO, highlighting their physical properties, roles, and informational attributes. Given this, here are the key concepts and their potential connections within the GMO that align with the ""Vessel"" entity in GBO:

Class: Vessel
This is the primary entity that represents vessels. It aligns directly with your GBO's ""Vessel"" class. In GMO, a vessel is a specific type of platform and is involved in cruises, aligning with the description provided.
Physical Properties (Observable Properties)
Properties like length, beam, draft, and displacement are modeled using the Property Value pattern, likely under a ""Property"" class or similar. These properties have names, values, and units, aligning with the QUDT ontologies. This aspect relates to how you might describe the physical characteristics of a vessel in GBO.
Agent Roles
The vessel's association with various roles, such as ownership or affiliation with an organization, is modeled using the ""Agent Role"" pattern. This involves classes like Agent, AgentRole, and object properties like providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy. This part of the ontology deals with the different roles that can be associated with a vessel, like ownership.
Information Object
Every vessel is described by exactly one information object, which includes identifiers, names, webpage URLs, and potentially more, like commissioning and decommissioning years. The InformationObject class and the isDescribedBy property are key to this aspect.
Nomenclature and Domain-Specific Terms
The ontology includes specific terms related to vessel properties and agent roles, organized under the Vessel pattern's URI namespace. This suggests there are specific classes or properties designed to describe vessel-related data, including physical properties and roles.
Domain and Range Restrictions
The ontology specifies domain and range restrictions for properties related to vessels, ensuring that relationships are semantically correct. For example, the isDescribedBy property links a vessel to its information object, and the hasProperty property links a vessel to its observable properties.
Disjointness Assertions
The ontology asserts that certain classes are disjoint, meaning they cannot overlap in their instances. This ensures clear semantic boundaries between concepts like vessels, information objects, time instants, agent roles, agents, and properties.
In summary, to find pieces in GMO related to the ""Vessel"" entity in GBO, you would look for classes and properties that describe physical characteristics of vessels, their roles and affiliations, and their informational descriptions. This includes looking into how observable properties are modeled, how agent roles are associated with vessels, and how each vessel is linked to an information object describing it.",FALSE,1/1,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

gmo: The Vessel pattern represents vessels on which cruises are carried out. A vessel is considered a type of platform, hence this pattern is aligned to the Platform pattern from Chapter 14.

We reuse/align to the Property Value pattern to model such observable properties. Here, each property would have a name, a value, and a unit.

Let's explore these related components:

Vessel as a Type of Platform: In both GMO and GBO ontologies, a vessel is considered a type of platform. This alignment suggests that any mention of vessels in GMO directly correlates with gbo:Vessel, especially in the context of cruises or maritime activities.
Ownership and Agent Roles: The GMO ontology discusses agent roles, including ownership, in the context of vessels. The gbo:hasOwner relationship can be directly related to GMO's use of agent roles where a vessel has an owner or is affiliated with an organization. In GMO, this is modeled through the Agent Role pattern, with specific object properties like ecglvs:providesAgentRole and ecglar:isPerformedBy potentially being involved in denoting ownership or affiliation relationships.
Observable Properties: The alignment with the Property Value pattern in GMO for modeling observable properties (e.g., length, beam, draft, displacement) of a vessel aligns with the detailed description of a gbo:Vessel. While GBO may not explicitly mention these properties, the focus on observable physical properties in GMO is a relevant link.
Information Object Pattern: The use of the Information Object pattern in GMO to include vessel identifiers, names, webpage, and additional information like year of commission and decommission is akin to how a gbo:Vessel might be described in terms of metadata or related information objects.
Nomenclature and Domain Restrictions: The detailed nomenclature part that includes terms describing properties relevant to a vessel and types of agent roles provided by a vessel, along with the assertion of guarded domain and range restrictions in GMO, would be crucial in mapping to gbo:Vessel and its relationships in GBO.
Object Properties and Classes: The specific mention of object properties like ecglvs:isDescribedBy, ecglvs:providesAgentRole, and classes such as ecglvs:Agent, ecglvs:AgentRole in GMO provides a direct way to map relationships and entities between GMO and GBO, especially regarding ownership and descriptive information about vessels.
Guarded Domain and Range Restrictions: The formal constraints and restrictions mentioned in GMO, such as every vessel having exactly one information object and the specific domain and range restrictions for properties and roles, offer a structured way to understand how vessels are represented and related to other concepts within the ontology. This structured representation can be directly compared with the gbo:Vessel and gbo:hasOwner semantics.
In summary, the related pieces in GMO that correlate with gbo:Vessel and gbo:hasOwner encompass the representation of vessels as platforms with observable properties, the modeling of ownership and affiliations through agent roles, the inclusion of detailed vessel information through the Information Object pattern, and the specific object properties and classes designed to capture these relationships and characteristics.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,2/5,0.6,,,2/5,0.6,,,,,

Since the GBO terms are defined with specific URIs that likely don't directly exist in the GMO ontology, we can't directly find relationships based on exact URI matches. Instead, we need to consider conceptual similarities or shared domains between the two ontologies.

A more effective approach might involve looking for classes or properties in GMO that conceptually match or are in the same domain as ""Vessel"" and ""isOwnerOf"" from GBO.

Given the detailed description of the GMO ontology related to the concept of a ""Vessel"" and how it interacts with other entities within the ontology, we can identify several key components in GMO that relate to the GBO concepts of a ""Vessel"" and the ""isOwnerOf"" relationship.

GMO Components Related to GBO's Vessel and isOwnerOf:
Vessel as a Class: In GMO, the ""Vessel"" is a core concept representing vessels that carry out cruises, aligned with the ""Platform"" pattern. This directly correlates with GBO's Vessel class.
Agent and AgentRole: The GMO ontology includes ""Agent"" and ""AgentRole"" classes, with the notion that a vessel can have associated agent roles, such as an owner, which directly relates to the isOwnerOf relationship in GBO. An agent (e.g., an organization or individual) performs certain roles for the vessel, including ownership.
Object Properties:
ecglvs:isPerformedBy and ecglar:isPerformedBy link agent roles to agents, indicating the execution of roles by agents. This can be conceptually related to the isOwnerOf relationship if one of the roles is that of an owner.
ecglvs:providesAgentRole and ecglar:providesAgentRole are used to indicate that a vessel provides certain agent roles, potentially including ownership.
Information Object: Every vessel is described by exactly one information object (ecglvs:isDescribedBy), which aligns with the information aspect of a ""Vessel"" in GBO. This encompasses identifiers, names, webpages, and additional information such as the year of commission and decommission.
Property and Observable Properties: The description mentions modeling observable properties of a vessel (e.g., length, beam, draft, displacement) with a pattern aligned to the QUDT ontologies. These properties make up the physical characteristics of a vessel, which might not have a direct counterpart in GBO but are crucial for defining a vessel's specifications.
Guarded Domain and Range Restrictions: The use of domain and range restrictions in GMO for properties related to vessels ensures that the relationships are accurately represented, similar to the specific use of isOwnerOf in GBO to link owners with vessels.
Nomenclature and Modeling Patterns: The GMO ontology's use of specific patterns (e.g., Agent Role pattern, Information Object pattern) and the detailed nomenclature for describing vessels and their associated roles and properties provide a structured way to represent and relate entities similar to the Vessel and isOwnerOf concepts in GBO.
These components from the GMO ontology provide a comprehensive framework for representing vessels, their properties, roles (including ownership), and descriptive information in a manner that correlates with the concepts found in GBO.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,1/4,0.75,,,1/4,0.75,,,,,

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

This broad perspective includes modeling cruises as events that occur within a spatiotemporal framework and involve various roles performed by agents.

Here are the related pieces in GMO that align with the GBO ontology's concept of a cruise (gbo:Cruise):

Cruise as an Event: The GMO models a cruise as a type of event, emphasizing the event's spatiotemporal dimensions and the roles of agents within it. This aligns with the GBO ontology's definition of a cruise, particularly regarding the cruise's characterization as an event that occurs over time and involves various participants.
Trajectory and Spatiotemporal Information: Both ontologies focus on the trajectory of a cruise, which consists of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. GMO's emphasis on trajectory as a collection of spatiotemporal fixes and segments closely relates to GBO's concept of a cruise being an abstraction of a path or route taken by a vessel.
Agent Roles and Participation: The role of agents (e.g., humans, organizations) in a cruise, as modeled through agent roles in GMO, is a crucial aspect that connects with the GBO ontology. This includes the notion of cruises providing roles to agents and involving them in various activities during the cruise.
Information Object Pattern: The GMO's use of the Information Object pattern to model non-spatiotemporal information about a cruise, such as funding awards or programs associated with it, can be seen as complementary to the GBO's approach to detailing cruises. This aspect emphasizes the broader context and background of cruises beyond their immediate physical and temporal characteristics.
Alignment with Other Patterns: GMO's alignment with various patterns, such as the Event, Agent Role, and Semantic Trajectory patterns, suggests a structured approach to modeling complex entities like cruises. This structured approach is inherently related to the GBO's method of defining a cruise through its relationship with vessels, trajectories, and agent roles.
Classes and Properties: Specific classes and properties in the GMO ontology, such as Cruise, Vessel, Trajectory, AgentRole, Port, and properties like hasTrajectory, isPerformedBy, hasLocation, atTime, align with the elements described in the GBO ontology snippet. These classes and properties facilitate the detailed modeling of cruises, their trajectories, the roles of participants, and the events that occur during a cruise.
The detailed modeling of cruises in GMO, considering them as complex events involving specific trajectories, agent roles, and additional information, presents a comprehensive framework that closely relates to the conceptualization of cruises in the GBO ontology. This connection is essential for ensuring interoperability and coherence between these ontologies in the context of modeling and understanding cruises in a broad, inclusive manner.",FALSE,1/1,1,8/9,0.1111111111,,,8/9,0.1111111111,,,,,

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The description suggests looking for classes and properties in GMO that relate to:

Event Modeling: Any classes or properties in GMO that model events, especially those occurring within a spatiotemporal context, could be directly relevant. This includes modeling of events as abstract entities that have temporal and spatial properties, involve agents, and potentially link to physical objects like vessels.
Trajectories and Movement: Components that represent the movement of objects through space and time, including the representation of trajectories, segments of movement, and the notion of fixes or waypoints. This also includes properties that connect these movements to physical objects (e.g., vessels) and locations (e.g., ports).
Agent and Role Modeling: Classes and properties that define agents (which could be individuals or organizations) and their roles, particularly in the context of events or activities. This would align with the agent role modeling mentioned in the description, where specific roles are assigned to agents within the context of a cruise.
Non-Spatiotemporal Information: Any constructs related to the modeling of information objects that describe aspects of cruises not covered by their spatial or temporal characteristics. This could include funding awards, programs, and digital objects like papers and reports related to a cruise.
Specific Entities and Relationships: Look for specific classes such as Port, Vessel, Trajectory, Segment, Fix, AgentRole, and their associated properties that mirror the structure of cruises as described in your overview.
Since direct matching might not always be possible due to the specific focus of each ontology, the goal is to find GMO components that can serve similar purposes or that could be extended or integrated to model the concepts related to cruises as described.

Let's now proceed to identify these related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the general description and focus areas mentioned.
Error analyzing
It seems I've encountered another technical issue while attempting to process the GMO ontology file to find related components based on the detailed description of the Cruise micro-ontology you provided. This might be due to the specificities of the data or the complexity of the query.

Although I can't directly access and process the file content at this moment, the approach to finding related pieces in the GMO ontology based on your description would typically involve:

Searching for Event-related Classes and Properties: This would include classes and properties that model events, particularly those that can encapsulate the complex nature of a cruise as an event with spatiotemporal dimensions.
Identifying Trajectory and Movement Modeling Components: Looking for how the ontology models trajectories, segments, and movement through space and time, including the connection of these elements to physical objects like vessels.
Agent and Role Modeling: Identifying how agents (individuals or organizations) and their roles are represented, especially in the context of events or activities like cruises.
Non-Spatiotemporal Information Modeling: Finding how the ontology handles information objects that describe aspects of cruises not related to their spatial or temporal properties.
Specific Entities and Their Relationships: Checking for the presence of specific classes such as Port, Vessel, Trajectory, Segment, Fix, and AgentRole, along with their related properties, that mirror the structure and concepts outlined in your Cruise micro-ontology description.
For a detailed and accurate analysis, you might consider using ontology editing and querying tools like Protégé with SPARQL to manually explore the GMO ontology for these related components. These tools can help you visually navigate the ontology and execute SPARQL queries to find related classes and properties based on your criteria.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Here's a breakdown of the potential related elements in GMO, based on the core concepts and properties described in your Cruise ontology:

Cruise as an Event and its Trajectory:
Cruise is modeled as an event, which implies looking for classes or instances in GMO that represent events or activities, especially those with spatial and temporal dimensions.
Trajectory, as a collection of spatiotemporal segments, suggests searching for properties or classes in GMO related to paths, routes, or movements through space and time.
Spatiotemporal Information:
The focus on spatiotemporal segments and fixes (time-stamped locations) indicates the importance of spatial and temporal properties or classes in GMO, such as those representing locations, time points, or intervals.
Agent Roles and Activities:
The ontology describes agent roles (e.g., AgentRole, Agent) and their activities or roles within a cruise. Thus, similar concepts of agents, roles, and their participation in events or activities would be relevant in GMO.
Information Object and Non-Spatiotemporal Information:
InformationObject related to cruises and their non-spatiotemporal attributes, such as funding or associated programs, suggests looking for classes or properties in GMO that model information objects, digital artifacts, or related metadata.
Alignment with Other Patterns and Ontologies:
The description mentions alignment with other patterns, such as Event, Agent Role, and Semantic Trajectory patterns. This suggests searching for GMO components that are designed to integrate or align with external patterns or ontologies, especially those concerning events, agents, and spatiotemporal information.
Specific Object Properties and Classes:
The list of object properties (e.g., hasLocation, atPort, providesAgentRole) and classes (e.g., Port, Vessel, AgentRole) provides a clear guide for searching related properties and classes in GMO that deal with location, participation, and categorization of entities involved in a cruise or similar events.
Given these points, the related pieces in GMO would ideally encompass the modeling of events (especially those with a strong spatiotemporal component), agent roles within these events, trajectories or paths taken by physical objects, and information objects that describe or are associated with these events. This includes any ontological structures that represent or can accommodate the modeling of physical and informational entities, their spatiotemporal dynamics, and their interrelations.",FALSE,0/1,0,12/12,0,Type(),,12/12,0,,,,,

Error analyzing
It seems there's a persistent issue preventing the analysis of the GMO ontology file you provided. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as file corruption, an unsupported format, or specific content that's causing the parsing process to fail.

Given this, there are a few approaches we can consider:

Manual Inspection: If the file is not too large, you could manually inspect it for properties and entities that might relate to the isCruiseTypeOf property in the GBO ontology. Look for terms like ""cruise"" or ""type"" and see if there are any corresponding object properties or classes.
Alternative Tools: There are other ontology tools and editors, such as Protégé, that can be used to open and inspect ontologies. These tools might offer more detailed error messages or better handling of certain ontology features.
Error Details: If you have access to tools that can open the ontology, checking for any specific errors or warnings given by those tools might help diagnose the problem.
If you have a specific part of the ontology you're curious about or can provide more details on what you're looking for, I might be able to offer more directed advice. ​","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:isCruiseTypeOf(x,y) ↔

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

Based on the detailed description of the Cruise micro-ontology and its alignment with various patterns such as Event, Agent, and Semantic Trajectory, here are the related parts in the GMO ontology that could be related to the gbo:isCruiseTypeOf property:

Object Properties:
ecglcr:hasTrajectory connects a cruise to its trajectory, emphasizing the path or route aspect, similar to the abstraction level of isCruiseTypeOf.
ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglev:providesAgentRole link cruises and events to roles performed by agents during a cruise, which might align with the notion of types or categories of cruises in GBO.
ecglcr:isPerformedBy and ecglev:isPerformedBy establish the connection between agent roles and the agents (e.g., humans or organizations) themselves, reflecting the participation aspect that could differentiate types of cruises.
ecglcr:isUndertakenBy specifically relates a cruise to a vessel, highlighting the operational aspect of cruises that could be relevant to the classification of cruise types in GBO.
Classes:
The ecglcr:Cruise class, obviously, is the central concept and could directly relate to the notion of cruise types in GBO.
ecglcr:AgentRole and ecglev:AgentRole represent roles that could be indicative of different types of cruises based on the roles involved (e.g., scientific research, sightseeing).
ecglcr:Trajectory and its components (like Segment, Fix, StartingFix, EndingFix) provide the spatiotemporal structure of a cruise, which could be fundamental in distinguishing between different cruise types in GBO based on their routes or significant locations (e.g., ports).
ecglcr:Vessel as a class could have subcategories or instances that reflect different types of cruises based on the vessel used (e.g., research vessels vs. pleasure cruise ships).
These connections and classes in the GMO ontology are fundamentally aligned with the notion of classifying or categorizing cruises in the GBO ontology under isCruiseTypeOf. The properties and classes emphasize the multidimensional aspects of cruises, including their operational, participatory, and spatiotemporal characteristics, which are essential for understanding and categorizing different types of cruises.",FALSE,0/1,0,7/7,0,Type(),,7/7,0,,,,,

It seems there was an issue trying to display the contents of the GMO ontology file directly. Instead, I'll proceed by examining the file in a way that focuses on identifying relevant parts related to the Cruise class and the hasChiefScientist property from the GBO ontology.

To do this, I will look for classes, properties, or concepts within the GMO ontology that mention or are conceptually linked to:

Events occurring on a vessel
The traversal of a trajectory
Roles or positions within such events, specifically focusing on the chief scientist
Let's proceed with this analysis. ​​
Error analyzing
It seems I encountered an issue while attempting to process the GMO ontology to find related concepts to your GBO ontology's definitions of Cruise and hasChiefScientist. This approach requires accessing and analyzing the ontology content in a specific technical context, which might not be feasible in our current setup or there might be an issue with how the data was accessed or processed.

Although I can't directly analyze the contents of the GMO ontology file at this moment, typically, to find related parts in another ontology like GMO based on GBO's Cruise class and hasChiefScientist property, you would look for:

Classes related to events, especially those happening on a vessel or related to maritime activities. This could include classes representing different types of cruises, voyages, or maritime expeditions.
Properties that define relationships between a cruise and its participants, specifically roles like a chief scientist. This could involve properties detailing who is participating in an event, their roles, and their expertise.
Concepts or individuals representing specific instances of cruises or roles within those cruises, such as specific scientific expeditions or named individuals who have served as chief scientists.

Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Given the detailed information about the Cruise micro-ontology within the GMO context, we can see how it models various aspects relevant to the concept of a cruise, focusing on its spatiotemporal characteristics, the roles of agents (including humans and organizations) involved, and the informational aspects surrounding a cruise. This comprehensive approach aligns closely with the concepts described in the GBO ontology, particularly in relation to the hasChiefScientist object property.

Here are related components in the GMO ontology that connect to the hasChiefScientist property in GBO:

Cruise as a Complicated Event: The GMO ontology models a cruise as a type of event, emphasizing the trajectory (path/route) undertaken by a vessel and the roles performed by agents (e.g., humans, organizations) within this context. This aligns with the GBO's view of a cruise where a chief scientist plays a pivotal role. In GMO, the providesAgentRole object property and the AgentRole class would be directly relevant.
Agent Roles: The notion that a cruise may provide an agent role, performed by an agent, is explicitly acknowledged. This directly corresponds to the hasChiefScientist property in GBO, as the chief scientist is a specific type of agent role within the context of a cruise.
Object Properties and Classes: The isPerformedBy object property in GMO, which links agent roles to their performers, would be relevant to mapping the relationship defined by hasChiefScientist in GBO. Additionally, the classes Agent and AgentRole in GMO are crucial for understanding and defining the specifics of the chief scientist's role within a cruise.
Information Object: The GMO ontology's use of the InformationObject class to encapsulate non-spatiotemporal information about a cruise, such as funding awards or programs associated with it, indirectly supports the role of a chief scientist. This is because the chief scientist's work often relates to the scientific goals, funding, and outcomes of a cruise, all of which are encapsulated within the InformationObject class.
Alignment with Other Patterns: The alignment with the Event pattern, the Agent Role pattern, and the Semantic Trajectory pattern in GMO provides a framework within which the role of a chief scientist (as modeled by hasChiefScientist in GBO) can be understood in a broader ontological context. These alignments help in modeling the trajectory, the event nature of a cruise, and the roles of agents involved, offering a comprehensive view that includes the chief scientist's role.
In summary, the related pieces in GMO to the hasChiefScientist property in GBO include the modeling of cruises as events with specific trajectories, the definition of agent roles within these events, and the detailed modeling of non-spatiotemporal information about cruises. These elements together provide a nuanced framework for understanding the role of a chief scientist within the context of a cruise, bridging the conceptual gap between the two ontologies.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

To find pieces in the GMO ontology that are related to the specified parts in the GBO ontology, I'll first need to inspect the content of the GMO ontology you've uploaded. This involves looking for classes, properties, or instances that have a semantic or functional relationship to ""Cruise"" (an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory) and ""isChiefScientistOf"" (an object property) as defined in the GBO ontology.

Let's start by examining the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. This will help me identify any related components.

It seems there was an issue accessing the contents of the GMO ontology file you uploaded. I'll attempt to approach this differently to access and analyze the content of the GMO ontology file. Let's try another method to read and inspect the file. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered another technical difficulty while attempting to analyze the GMO ontology file. Unfortunately, this prevents me from directly inspecting the file and identifying related pieces to the ""Cruise"" class and the ""isChiefScientistOf"" property from the GBO ontology.

However, I can still provide some general advice on how you might approach this task:

Identify Similar Concepts: Look for classes in the GMO ontology that represent events, particularly those involving movement or transportation, which could be similar to the ""Cruise"" class in GBO. Similarly, for ""isChiefScientistOf,"" search for properties that denote leadership or roles within events or activities.

Check for Shared Vocabulary: Sometimes, ontologies share common vocabulary or reference standard ontologies for certain concepts. If the GMO ontology references external vocabularies, it might use similar or the same terms as GBO for related concepts.

Examine Object Properties: For the ""isChiefScientistOf"" property, look for object properties in GMO that link individuals to events or roles, especially those implying a hierarchy or a special status such as a chief scientist.

Use Ontology Tools: Tools like Protégé or web-based ontology viewers can help you visually explore the GMO ontology. These tools often provide features to search for specific classes or properties and examine their relationships.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.

(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.

(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

In the context provided, the Cruise micro-ontology focuses on modeling cruises as events that involve agents performing roles within a spatiotemporal framework, which is a natural fit for identifying analogous or related concepts to the isChiefScientistOf relationship.

Related Components in GMO to gbo:isChiefScientistOf
ObjectProperties Relevant to Agent Roles:

ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy are particularly relevant as they pertain to the roles performed by agents in the context of a cruise. These properties align with the idea of assigning specific roles to individuals, akin to the isChiefScientistOf relationship.
Classes Related to Agents and Roles:

ecglcr:AgentRole and ecglcr:Agent classes are central to modeling the participation of individuals or organizations in cruises. The description indicates that a cruise can have agent roles such as a chief scientist, which directly corresponds to the concept of isChiefScientistOf.
Operational Cruise Definition:

The description includes a specific mention that an operational cruise is defined by having a chief scientist and being funded by a funding award. This directly correlates to the isChiefScientistOf relationship, highlighting the role of the chief scientist within the cruise ontology.
Class and Property Alignments:

The alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with other patterns, especially the Event pattern, suggests a sophisticated model where agents, roles, and events are interlinked. This broader framework supports the identification and modeling of roles such as that of a chief scientist.
Synthesis
Given these components, the ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy properties, along with the ecglcr:AgentRole class, are directly relevant to the gbo:isChiefScientistOf relationship. These elements of the GMO ontology facilitate the assignment of roles to agents within the context of a cruise, embodying the concept of a chief scientist's role in a manner that aligns with the intentions of the GBO ontology's corresponding property. Additionally, the explicit mention of a chief scientist in the operational definition of a cruise further solidifies the connection between these ontological components.",FALSE,4/4,1,1/5,0.8,,,1/5,0.8,,,,,

Error analyzing
It seems I've encountered another issue while trying to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO details you've provided. This error might be related to how I'm handling the ontology data or searching within it. Given this, I'll adjust my approach to address the task without directly querying the ontology in a way that's causing these errors.

Let's discuss a conceptual approach to how you can find related entities in two different ontologies like GMO and GBO:

Term Matching: Look for exact matches or similar labels between entities in both ontologies. For instance, if GBO has a class ""Cruise,"" you could search for a class with a similar name in GMO.

Property Matching: If GBO has specific properties, like ""hasCoChiefScientist,"" you could look for properties in GMO that serve a similar role, perhaps something related to personnel or roles within an event or activity.

Hierarchy Inspection: Examine the class hierarchies in GMO to find classes that might be equivalent or closely related to those in GBO. For example, if ""Cruise"" is a subclass of an ""Event"" in GBO, there might be a similar structure in GMO.

Domain and Range Comparison: Properties like ""hasCoChiefScientist"" have specific domains and ranges (in this case, ""Cruise"" and ""Person""). Finding properties in GMO with similar domain and range relationships could indicate relatedness.

Semantic Similarity: Beyond direct string matching, semantic similarity tools or ontology alignment tools can help identify related concepts based on the meanings and contexts of terms.

If you're looking for a specific type of relationship or more detailed assistance on how to programmatically achieve these comparisons, please let me know!","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ hasCoChiefScientist(x, z)  ↔

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise (GBO) and Cruise (GMO): The description from GMO elaborates on a cruise being a complex event, incorporating aspects such as a trajectory (a path through space over time), involvement of agents (e.g., humans or organizations), and associated non-spatiotemporal information (e.g., funding awards, programs). This aligns with the GBO's conceptualization of a cruise as an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory, suggesting a strong thematic overlap.

hasCoChiefScientist (GBO) ↔ Agent Roles in Cruise (GMO): In GMO, the notion of agent roles within a cruise is significant, with explicit modeling of agent roles, such as the role of a chief scientist. This directly correlates with the GBO's concept of ""hasCoChiefScientist,"" indicating a property that assigns a specific agent role (in this case, a co-chief scientist) to a cruise. The detailed modeling in GMO, which includes agent roles as part of the cruise's event structure, provides a framework for including various specific roles, such as a co-chief scientist.

Related Concepts in GMO:

Object Properties:
ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy directly relate to the assignment of roles like the co-chief scientist in a cruise context, matching the hasCoChiefScientist property from GBO.
ecglcr:hasTrajectory aligns with the description of a cruise involving a path or route, underlying the GBO's conceptualization.
Classes:
The AgentRole and Agent classes are pivotal in defining the participants and their roles within a cruise, akin to the concept of having a co-chief scientist in GBO.
The Cruise class, as described, is a complex event that could be directly related to GBO's Cruise, emphasizing the event-like nature of the cruise, inclusive of its trajectory and agent roles.
Trajectory, Segment, Fix, and related classes and properties such as hasFix, nextFix, and atPort support the notion of a cruise as a spatial and temporal journey, which is foundational to both the GBO and GMO ontologies.
These mappings and relations demonstrate a conceptual link between the GBO's specific interest in cruises and co-chief scientists, and the GMO's broader, detailed ontology that encompasses these concepts within a structured model of cruises as complex events with trajectories, agent roles, and associated informational objects.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

The GMO ontology describes a comprehensive model that encompasses aspects of a cruise, including its trajectory, the agents involved (such as scientists), events, and other related concepts.

Related Elements in GMO to GBO's ""Cruise"" and ""isCoChiefScientistOf""
Cruise as an Event:

GMO models a cruise as a type of event, which aligns with the notion of a cruise in GBO as an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory. This is captured under the classes ecglcr:Cruise and ecglev:Event, suggesting a strong conceptual alignment.
Trajectory and Movement:

The detailed trajectory model in GMO, which includes object properties like ecglcr:hasTrajectory, ecglcr:nextFix, and ecglcr:hasFix, directly relates to the path/route aspect of a cruise in GBO. This includes the spatial and temporal dimensions of a cruise's path, which are central to understanding a cruise in both ontologies.
Agent Roles:

The concept of agent roles, especially the roles performed during a cruise, is extensively modeled in GMO. Properties such as ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy, along with the class ecglcr:AgentRole, are directly relevant to the ""isCoChiefScientistOf"" object property in GBO. These elements in GMO can be used to represent the roles of different agents (including co-chief scientists) in the context of a cruise.
Vessel and Ports:

The representation of the vessel that undertakes the cruise and the ports involved are significant in both GMO and GBO. In GMO, this is modeled through classes and properties like ecglcr:Vessel, ecglcr:Port, and ecglcr:atPort, which could be related to the broader understanding of a cruise in GBO as involving a vessel traversing a trajectory with specific stops (ports).
Information Object and Funding:

The inclusion of non-spatiotemporal information relevant to a cruise, such as funding awards, programs, and digital objects describing the cruise, is addressed in GMO through the ecglcr:InformationObject class and related properties. This aspect is indirectly related to the roles and events in a cruise as described in GBO, particularly if considering the broader context in which these cruises operate, including their scientific and operational funding.
The detailed modeling in GMO of aspects like the trajectory of a cruise, the roles of agents (including scientists), and the physical and informational infrastructure surrounding a cruise provides a rich set of elements that align with the description of a cruise in GBO. The alignment extends not only to the specific class of ""Cruise"" but also to the roles agents play within that context, offering a nuanced framework for understanding cruises in a broader ontological landscape.",FALSE,4/4,1,8/12,0.3333333333,,,8/12,0.3333333333,,,,,

Error analyzing
It looks like I'm facing a persistent issue accessing the content of the GMO ontology file directly. However, I can still provide guidance on how you might approach finding related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the information from the GBO ontology you've shared.

Given the nature of the concepts ""Cruise"" and the relationship ""isScientistOf"" from the GBO ontology:

Cruise: Look for classes in GMO that represent events or activities occurring over a period, especially those involving transportation or scientific exploration. Classes related to vessels, watercraft, or any form of maritime travel would be particularly relevant. Additionally, look for classes or properties that might represent or connect to the concept of a trajectory, which could indicate movement or travel paths.

isScientistOf: This object property suggests a relationship between individuals (presumably scientists) and an entity (which could be events, projects, or organizations). In the GMO ontology, search for object properties that denote roles, affiliations, or participation of individuals in activities or organizations. Properties that link people to their work, research, or contributions would be of interest.

To find these relations:

Use ontology exploration tools or software that can handle the Turtle (TTL) format, such as Protégé.
Search for terms like ""event"", ""activity"", ""vessel"", ""trajectory"", ""scientist"", ""research"", and their synonyms.
Examine the RDF types (classes), RDF properties (especially object properties), and any specific instances that match or are conceptually similar to the concepts you're interested in from GBO.
This approach should help you identify related concepts in the GMO ontology despite the direct access issue.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise as an Event with a Trajectory: In GMO, a Cruise is modeled as a type of event, characterized by its trajectory. This aligns closely with the GBO concept of a Cruise, especially when considering the ""isScientistOf"" relationship. The trajectory's modeling, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel, is directly relevant to understanding the cruise's path or route, which is central to both ontologies.

Agent Roles in a Cruise: The GMO ontology describes agent roles within the context of a cruise, which includes humans or organizations performing specific roles. This directly correlates with the ""isScientistOf"" relationship in GBO, where an agent (e.g., a scientist) is associated with a cruise. In GMO, agent roles are specified, and among these roles, there could be a ""scientist"" role, highlighting the participation of scientists in cruises. This connection is established through properties like ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy, which facilitate the modeling of roles agents play in a cruise.

Alignment with Other Patterns: The GMO ontology's alignment with patterns like Agent, Agent Role, and Event is critical for representing cruises as complex events involving agents with specific roles. This alignment ensures a rich semantic framework for representing the involvement of scientists in cruises, akin to the ""isScientistOf"" relationship in GBO.

Information Objects Related to a Cruise: The aspect of non-spatiotemporal information relevant to a cruise, such as funding awards or programs associated with it, modeled through the Information Object pattern, provides a broader context that might intersect with the ""isScientistOf"" relationship. For example, the involvement of a scientist in a cruise could be tied to specific research programs or funding awards, aspects that are captured in the GMO ontology.

Classes and Properties: Relevant classes and properties in GMO that align with the GBO concepts include Cruise, AgentRole, Agent, and object properties like hasTrajectory, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, and atPort. These elements can be used to model the relationship between scientists and cruises, emphasizing the roles scientists play, the paths cruises take, and how these aspects are interrelated.

To summarize, the relevant pieces in GMO that relate to the GBO concepts of a Cruise event and the ""isScientistOf"" relationship are found in the detailed modeling of cruises as complex events involving trajectories, agent roles, and the interplay of various classes and properties that capture the essence of these concepts within the ontology's framework.",FALSE,4/4,1,4/8,0.5,,,4/8,0.5,,,,,

13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object.

The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.

This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Related Components in GMO to GBO's ""Cruise""
Cruise: In GMO, a cruise is defined as an event, which aligns with the GBO's notion of a cruise being an event occurring on a vessel. This is encapsulated in the Class: Cruise in GMO, similar to GBO.

Trajectory and Vessel: The GMO ontology details a cruise's trajectory, which is a collection of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. This directly relates to GBO's ""Cruise"" class, which could involve an educator moving along a trajectory. The relevant GMO classes and properties include Class: Trajectory, ObjectProperty: hasTrajectory, and Class: Vessel.

Agent and AgentRole: The involvement of agents (e.g., humans or organizations) in a cruise is modeled through agent roles in GMO. This could correspond to the educator role in GBO's ""hasEducator"". Relevant GMO components include Class: Agent, Class: AgentRole, ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole, and ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy.

Related Components in GMO to GBO's ""hasEducator""
providesAgentRole and isPerformedBy: These object properties in GMO could be used to model the relationship between a cruise (as an event) and the educators (as agents performing roles). Specifically, ObjectProperty: providesAgentRole might align with assigning an educator to a cruise, and ObjectProperty: isPerformedBy could represent the participation of an educator in a cruise.

Information Object and Program: Additional details about a cruise, such as educational programs associated with it, could be represented using Class: InformationObject and Class: Program in GMO.

It seems there was an issue accessing the content of the GMO ontology file you uploaded.

I'll attempt to read the file again and extract relevant information. ​​
Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering difficulties accessing and reading the content of the GMO ontology file directly. Given these limitations, I can provide a general approach on how to manually find pieces in GMO that are related to the ""Cruise"" class and the ""isEducatorIn"" property mentioned in your GBO ontology.

For the ""Cruise"" Class: Search the GMO ontology for classes that represent events, activities, or entities related to vessels, water travel, or trajectories. These could include classes directly representing vessels, trips, or navigational paths. Pay special attention to properties and comments that link these classes to the concept of a cruise or related activities.

For the ""isEducatorIn"" Property: Look for object properties in GMO that denote roles, activities, or relations involving teaching, education, or guidance within a particular context. This could involve properties linking individuals to educational events, roles within a learning activity, or associations between educators and other entities.

Semantic Relations: Examine the semantic relationships between classes and properties in GMO and those in GBO. This includes subclassing (rdfs:subClassOf), domain and range specifications (rdfs:domain, rdfs:range), and annotations that provide semantic context (rdfs:comment, rdfs:label).

Equivalent or Similar Concepts: Look for owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty relations that might explicitly link concepts in GMO to those in GBO, indicating direct equivalents or very closely related concepts.

This approach requires a manual or programmatic analysis of the GMO ontology. If you have specific tools or environments you're working within (e.g., Protégé, RDFLib in Python), they can facilitate searching and analyzing these relationships. If you can describe the environment or tools you're using, I might be able to provide more directed advice on how to proceed. ​","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:Cruise(z) ∧ isEducatorIn(x, z) ↔

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The connection between these concepts in GBO and GMO revolves around the representation of a cruise as an event, the roles of agents (including potentially educators) within a cruise, and the spatiotemporal aspects of the cruise event. Here are the relevant parts and their relationships:

Cruise as an Event (Related to GBO's ""Cruise""): In GMO, a cruise is modeled as a type of event, emphasizing the spatiotemporal dimension and agent involvement. This aligns with the GBO's notion of a ""Cruise"" as an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory. The key concepts include:

Cruise (Class): Defined within the context of an event, it aligns closely with the GBO ""Cruise"" by emphasizing its event nature, involving a trajectory traversed by a vessel.
Trajectory (Class): Represents the path/route undertaken by the cruise vessel, consisting of spatiotemporal segments, which directly ties to the GBO ""Cruise"" abstraction.
Vessel (Class): The physical object undertaking the cruise, a central element to both GBO's and GMO's understanding of a cruise.
Agent Roles (Related to GBO's ""isEducatorIn""): The GMO ontology discusses agent roles within a cruise, which could encompass educators among other roles. This connects to the GBO's ""isEducatorIn"" property by indicating participation or performance of roles within a cruise event. Key concepts include:

AgentRole (Class): A class that might include or be extended to include roles such as educators, aligning with the ""isEducatorIn"" property of GBO.
providesAgentRole (ObjectProperty): This property in GMO could be analogous to GBO's ""isEducatorIn,"" signifying the assignment of roles, including educational ones, to agents within the context of a cruise.
Spatiotemporal and Informational Aspects:

The detailed modeling of spatiotemporal aspects (like fixes, segments, and the trajectory) emphasizes the importance of the journey's path and timing, which is essential to understanding the context in which an educator could be involved in a cruise.
InformationObject (Class): Related to non-spatiotemporal information about the cruise, it could include details about educational programs or objectives, providing a link to the concept of educational involvement in cruises.
To summarize, the connection between GBO's ""Cruise"" and ""isEducatorIn"" with GMO's ontology involves understanding a cruise as a complex event characterized by its trajectory, the roles of agents (potentially including educators), and the inclusion of both spatiotemporal and informational aspects. The specific alignment of ""isEducatorIn"" with GMO's properties would hinge on how roles are defined and associated with agents within the context of a cruise event.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,4/8,0.5,,,4/8,0.5,,,,,

Let's approach this from a theoretical standpoint, given the typical structures found in ontologies and the information you've provided about GBO.

In ontologies, relatedness can be determined through several avenues:

Semantic Similarity: Looking for classes or properties in GMO that have a similar meaning or use as Cruise and hasStudent in GBO. For example, any class or property related to events on vehicles or properties denoting participation could be relevant.

Class Hierarchy: If GMO contains a class hierarchy that includes classes for events, vehicles (like vessels), or people (like students), we could identify classes that are superclasses or subclasses of Cruise and entities related to Person.

Property Domain and Range: In GBO, hasStudent has a domain of Cruise and a range of Person. In GMO, we'd look for properties with similar domains and ranges—properties that connect events or activities to individuals.

Inverse Properties: Given that hasStudent is inverse of isStudentIn, we'd search for any inverse property pairs in GMO that connect similar concepts.

Without being able to directly query the GMO ontology due to the technical hiccup, here's a hypothetical strategy to find related pieces in GMO based on the GBO ontology you've provided:

Search for classes that represent any form of event or gathering, particularly those that involve transportation or are specific to certain types of vehicles.
Look for object properties that denote a relationship between an event and participants or roles within that event. This includes properties with domains and ranges involving event-like classes and people or roles akin to ""student"".
Explore the ontology for inverse properties that might reflect the inverse relationship observed in GBO between hasStudent and isStudentIn.

More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Here's how these elements correspond:

Cruise as an Event and Vessel Involvement:

GMO details a cruise not just as a journey but as an event with a significant emphasis on its spatiotemporal aspects, aligning closely with the GBO notion of a Cruise as an event occurring on a vessel. In GMO, a cruise is an abstraction of a path or route taken by a vessel, which fits well with the GBO's idea of a cruise involving students (or agents in a broader sense) in an educational or observational capacity.
Agent Roles and Participation:

The concept of hasStudent in GBO implies the presence of roles played by individuals in the context of a cruise. GMO expands on this by modeling agent roles performed by agents (humans or organizations) within a cruise, akin to the hasStudent property. This property could be analogous to providesAgentRole or isPerformedBy in GMO, reflecting the participation of individuals in various capacities on a cruise.
Spatiotemporal Dimensions and Trajectory:

The trajectory aspect of a cruise in GMO, with its emphasis on spatiotemporal segments, correlates with the GBO concept of a cruise journeying through a trajectory. This is particularly relevant when considering the hasStudent relationship in GBO, as the educational or observational activities likely occur within the spatial and temporal confines of the cruise's trajectory.
Object Properties Relating to Agent Involvement and Cruise Attributes:

Properties such as providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, hasTrajectory, and isUndertakenBy in GMO directly relate to the notion of a cruise in GBO and the involvement of students (or agents). These properties encapsulate the relationships between the cruise event, its participants, and the trajectory or journey it undertakes.
Class Correspondences:

Classes such as AgentRole, Agent, Cruise, Trajectory, and Vessel in GMO correspond to the entities involved in a GBO Cruise and its relationship with students. The Cruise class in both ontologies serves as the focal point around which these relationships and roles revolve.
In summary, related pieces in GMO to the GBO query involving Cruise and hasStudent include the conceptualization of cruises as events involving agents with specific roles, the emphasis on spatiotemporal dimensions, and the properties and classes that model these relationships. The ontology's structure around cruises, agents, trajectories, and related properties provides a comprehensive framework for capturing the essence of a cruise and its participants in various capacities, similar to the educational context suggested by the hasStudent relationship in GBO.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

It appears I encountered another issue while attempting to process your request again. This might be due to an oversight in handling the ontology data or a technical constraint in my environment. Although I can't directly execute the query as intended, I can suggest an approach for you to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology snippets you've provided:

For Classes like ""Cruise"": You should look for classes in the GMO ontology that are either subclasses or superclasses of a class similar to ""Cruise"" or have annotations (like comments or labels) that mention terms related to ""Cruise"", such as ""Vessel"", ""Trajectory"", or ""Event"". This involves searching for triples with rdf:type owl:Class and filtering by rdfs:subClassOf or owl:equivalentClass relations, as well as scanning through rdfs:comment and rdfs:label for relevant keywords.

For Object Properties like ""isStudentIn"": Search for object properties in the GMO ontology that might serve a similar role or are related in the hierarchy to ""isStudentIn"". This involves identifying triples with rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty and exploring their relations using predicates like rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentProperty, or even their domain and range specifications.

Given these steps, if you have access to a SPARQL endpoint or a tool that can query RDF graphs, you can construct queries to systematically find entities in GMO that relate to the ones you've identified in GBO. If you need further assistance constructing such queries or if there's anything else I can help with, please let me know!","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:Cruise(z) ∧ isStudentIn(x, z)  ↔

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.

The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.

We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].

In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information.

We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop.

This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.

In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6.

This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise as an Event and Trajectory:

The Cruise ontology models cruises as events, aligning with the Event pattern. This includes representing a cruise's spatiotemporal aspects, particularly its trajectory, which is a path through space and time undertaken by a vessel. In the GMO ontology, look for classes or properties that align with this notion, particularly those related to events, trajectories, spatiotemporal information, or vessels.
Agent Roles in Cruise:

The description emphasizes agent roles within a cruise, aligning with Agent and Agent Role patterns. This suggests the involvement of various types of agents (e.g., humans, organizations) playing specific roles in a cruise. Relevant to isStudentIn, search the GMO for object properties and classes that deal with agents, roles they may play, and relationships between agents and activities or events, especially in educational or research contexts.
Information Object for Cruise:

The ontology models non-spatiotemporal information about a cruise through Information Objects, which can describe various aspects like funding awards or programs associated with a cruise. In GMO, search for patterns or classes related to informational entities, documentation, digital objects, or any constructs that serve to describe or document events or entities.
Operational Details of Cruise:

Operational aspects, such as the cruise being undertaken by a vessel, funding details, and specific roles like a chief scientist, indicate a focus on the practical execution and support of a cruise. In GMO, look for properties and classes related to operational aspects of activities, such as funding, roles specific to operations, and the physical undertaking of events.
Specific Object Properties:

The detailed ontology mentions several specific object properties like hasTrajectory, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, which are directly related to modeling the dynamics of a cruise. In GMO, related properties would likely connect agents to their roles, events to their spatiotemporal characteristics, and describe interactions or relationships pivotal to the understanding of a cruise or analogous events.
To locate these related pieces in the GMO ontology, it would be necessary to query or explore the ontology for classes and properties that align with the concepts of events, agents and their roles, trajectories, and information objects, as well as operational details of conducting an event like a cruise. This would involve searching for terms, examining class hierarchies, and exploring the relationships defined within the ontology to find matches or analogs to the constructs used in the Cruise ontology as described.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

It looks like I've encountered a technical problem trying to process the GMO ontology file to find related pieces to your GBO ontology. This might be due to an issue with the file format, a mismatch in the expected ontology structure, or a limitation in my current environment.

Since direct querying didn't work as expected, we might need to take a different approach to solve your query.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise as an Event with Spatiotemporal Dimensions: The GMO ontology models a cruise significantly as an event with a spatiotemporal boundary, defined by its trajectory and the involvement of agents (e.g., humans or organizations) performing roles within that event. This aligns with the notion of a cruise in GBO, where a cruise is an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory and potentially involving observers (agents in different roles).

Trajectory and Vessel Relationship: In GMO, a cruise's trajectory is a key aspect, entailing spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. This matches the GBO concept where a cruise might be understood through its path or route, implicitly linked to a vessel's movement.

Agent and Agent Roles: The GMO ontology incorporates Agent and AgentRole classes, aligning with the GBO's use of observers in cruises. Observers in GBO can be paralleled with agents performing specific roles in a GMO cruise event. The object property providesAgentRole in GMO directly relates to the notion of hasObserver in GBO, indicating the assignment of roles or activities to agents within a cruise.

Information Object and Non-spatiotemporal Information: The GMO ontology uses InformationObject to model non-spatiotemporal information related to a cruise, such as funding awards or associated programs. This might align with additional details relevant to GBO cruises but not explicitly covered under the GBO ontology's Cruise class description.

Ontology Imports and Reusability: The GMO ontology's approach to importing and reusing components from other ontologies (e.g., cruise-to-agent, cruise-to-event) indicates a modular and extensible structure. This principle of reusability and modular design could be relevant if the GBO ontology aims to integrate or align with broader ontological frameworks or extend its coverage beyond the initial scope.

Object Properties Related to Cruise Management: Various object properties like hasTrajectory, isPerformedBy, hasLocation, and atTime in GMO could be relevant to managing details about cruises in GBO, especially regarding the assignment of observers, managing spatial and temporal aspects of cruises, and detailing the roles and activities within a cruise.

The relationship between gbo:Cruise(x) ∧ hasObserver(x, y) and the corresponding elements in GMO suggests a detailed modeling of cruises that includes their spatiotemporal aspects, the roles of agents within these events, and the management of related non-spatiotemporal information. The concepts of trajectory, agent roles, and the event-centric view of cruises are key parallels that tie these ontologies together.",FALSE,4/4,1,5/9,0.4444444444,,,5/9,0.4444444444,,,,,

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find pieces in the GMO ontology that relate to the specified parts of the GBO ontology, I'll need to analyze the content of the GMO ontology file you've uploaded. This will involve looking for classes, object properties, or other ontology elements that are semantically or directly related to the concepts of ""Cruise"" (as an event on a vessel traversing a trajectory) and ""isObserverIn"" (as an object property).

I will start by examining the GMO ontology file to identify any relevant classes, properties, or relationships. Let's begin.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue processing the GMO ontology to find related elements to those described in your GBO ontology. The error occurred while trying to parse or search through the ontology, which might be due to the specific content or structure of the GMO file.

To proceed, we can try a more focused approach to directly query for elements related to ""Cruise"" and ""isObserverIn"" within the GMO ontology. This will involve constructing specific queries that look for classes and properties that either match these names or have semantic connections to the concepts of cruising events and observer relationships.

Let's adjust our approach and try again. ​​
Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered another issue trying to execute a SPARQL query on the GMO ontology to find related elements to the ""Cruise"" class and ""isObserverIn"" property from your GBO ontology. This problem could be due to several reasons, such as issues with the ontology file itself or the specifics of how the query was constructed and executed.

Given these challenges, I recommend a few alternative approaches:

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology is not too large, manual inspection could be feasible to identify related elements. This involves looking at the ontology in a text editor or an RDF viewer to search for relevant classes and properties.

Ontology Tools: Utilizing dedicated ontology management and visualization tools (e.g., Protégé, WebVOWL) could provide a more intuitive way to explore the GMO ontology and find elements related to your GBO ontology concepts.

Query Adjustment: Adjusting the SPARQL query to be more general or targeted, depending on the structure of the GMO ontology. This could involve simplifying the query or focusing on specific sections of the ontology.

Without being able to process the file directly due to the encountered issues, these alternative methods might help in identifying the relationships and elements you're interested in exploring within the GMO ontology.","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:Cruise(z) ∧ isObserverIn(x, z) →

Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it.

In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above.

For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.

(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise as an Event and Its Trajectory:

The concept of a cruise being an abstraction of a path or route undertaken by a vessel and modeled as an event with a spatiotemporal boundary suggests looking for elements in the GMO ontology related to events, trajectories, paths, vessels, and spatiotemporal information.
Related elements in GMO might include classes or properties for events, paths/routes, and objects that move through space (such as vessels), and their trajectories or segments thereof.
Agent Roles in Cruises:

The involvement of agents (humans or organizations) performing roles in cruises, and the alignment with patterns like Agent, Agent Role, and Event, indicates the relevance of looking for agent-related classes or properties, roles they can perform, and how these roles are linked to events or activities in the GMO ontology.
Related elements in GMO could be classes or properties that define or describe agents, roles they may assume, and the events or activities these roles are associated with.
Non-spatiotemporal Information and Information Objects:

The description of cruises also including non-spatiotemporal information through information objects (like funding awards, programs, digital objects) suggests the importance of information object patterns, and properties or classes related to the description, funding, and documentation of events or activities.
Related elements in GMO might involve classes or properties that describe or relate to information objects, their attributes, and how these objects are connected to the primary entities (like cruises or events).
Specific Object Properties:

Object properties like hasTrajectory, providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, hasLocation, and others that connect various aspects of cruises (trajectory, agent roles, spatial information) could be mirrored or have equivalents in the GMO ontology that relate to the organization, participation, and spatial/temporal aspects of events or activities.
Related elements in GMO could be object properties that link events, agents, locations, trajectories, and other relevant entities in a manner similar to those described for the Cruise ontology.
Given this understanding, searching the GMO ontology for related elements would involve identifying classes and properties that encompass events (particularly those with significant spatiotemporal components), agent roles and participation, information objects and documentation, as well as the connections between these through relevant object properties. This would align with finding equivalents or related concepts to those detailed in your description of the Cruise micro-ontology.",FALSE,4/4,1,3/7,0.5714285714,,,3/7,0.5714285714,,,,,

Manual Inspection: If the ontologies are not excessively large, manually inspecting them for related classes, properties, and relationships can be effective.

Semantic Search Tools: Tools that perform semantic searches over RDF data could be used to query the GMO ontology for terms related to those in the GBO ontology. SPARQL queries, in particular, can be very powerful for this purpose.

Ontology Alignment Tools: There are tools and frameworks designed to find correspondences or alignments between ontologies. These tools can help identify semantically similar concepts across different ontologies by analyzing the structure, labels, and relationships defined in them.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise Conceptualization: The GMO ontology details a sophisticated approach to conceptualizing a cruise, much like the GBO ontology's notion of a cruise as an event that occurs on a vessel traversing a trajectory. Both ontologies align on the idea that a cruise is not merely a physical journey but also encompasses various events, activities, and roles played by different agents (including organizations).

Agent and Agent Roles: In GMO, cruises are associated with agent roles performed by agents, which can be humans or organizations. This directly relates to the GBO ontology's concept of a cruise having an operator (organization), emphasizing the roles entities play in the context of a cruise. The properties like ecglcr:providesAgentRole and ecglcr:isPerformedBy in GMO would correspond to relationships involving cruise operations and their operators in GBO.

Trajectory and Vessel: The detailed discussion on trajectories and their significance in modeling cruises in GMO aligns with the GBO ontology's underlying assumption that a cruise involves a vessel following a certain path or route. The GMO ontology's emphasis on modeling this aspect through classes like Trajectory, Segment, Fix, and properties like hasTrajectory, isTraversedBy (vessel), nextFix (for ordering fixes) would find parallels in how GBO considers the physical journey aspect of a cruise.

Object Properties and Classes Related to Operations: In GMO, properties such as isUndertakenBy (relating a cruise to the vessel undertaking it) and classes like Vessel and Cruise themselves are directly relevant to the GBO ontology's interest in cruises and their operators. These elements underline the operational dimensions of cruises, from planning and executing the journey to the roles and responsibilities of organizing entities.

InformationObject and Related Properties: The GMO ontology's use of InformationObject to encapsulate non-spatiotemporal information about a cruise, such as funding awards and programs associated with it, reflects a broader understanding of what constitutes a cruise's operational context. This could relate to the GBO ontology's interest in the operators (organizations) in terms of their administrative and logistical involvement in cruises.

In summary, elements within the GMO ontology that align with the GBO ontology's focus on ""Cruise"" and ""hasOperator"" include the detailed modeling of cruises as events with significant spatiotemporal dimensions, the roles of agents (including organizations) in these events, the trajectories that define the physical aspect of cruises, and the broader operational context as captured through various classes and properties related to vessels, agent roles, and information objects. These connections underscore a shared emphasis on the complexity and multifaceted nature of cruises as both physical journeys and organized events involving various stakeholders.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise.

First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory.

Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it.

In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,

In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The ontology emphasizes the modeling of cruises as complex events that encompass trajectories, agent roles, and additional related information objects.

Given this context, let's identify related pieces in the GMO ontology that could correlate with the aspects described for GBO's concept of a cruise:

Cruise as an Event with Trajectory: The GMO might have concepts representing events, particularly those involving physical objects moving through space over time. Look for classes or properties related to events, trajectories, or paths, and those that describe the movement of vessels or any objects through space.

Agent and Agent Roles: The GMO could include classes or properties related to agents (individuals or organizations) and their roles within events or activities. These might be directly named as ""Agent"" or ""AgentRole"" or could include similar terminology indicating entities that participate in or perform specific functions within events.

Spatial and Temporal Aspects: Look for elements in GMO that deal with spatial locations (e.g., ports, specific geographic locations) and temporal information (time stamps, durations). These might be represented through classes or properties dealing with geographical concepts or time-related data.

Information Objects and Non-spatiotemporal Information: The GMO might contain concepts similar to InformationObject for representing digital or physical items that contain data about cruises or related activities. This could include anything from funding information to digital documents like reports or papers.

Specific Object Properties: In the GMO, seek properties that align with those mentioned for the Cruise ontology, such as properties dealing with locations, trajectories, agent roles, and the relationships between these concepts (e.g., ""isTraversedBy,"" ""hasTrajectory,"" ""providesAgentRole"").

Given the specifics of the Cruise ontology, the related pieces in GMO are likely to be those that can represent complex events involving physical movements, roles of various agents, and the encapsulation of both spatial-temporal and non-spatial-temporal information. The emphasis on reusability and alignment with established modeling practices suggests looking for similarly grounded and interconnected elements within the GMO ontology.

Unfortunately, due to the earlier technical issues encountered while trying to directly analyze the GMO file, I can't provide specific matching elements from GMO without further details or a successful review of the ontology file.

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

Cruise as a Class: In GMO, a cruise is defined as an event (subclass of Event), emphasizing its nature as an abstraction of a path or route taken by a vessel through space within a certain duration. This aligns with the GBO's definition of a ""Cruise"" as an event occurring on a vessel traversing a trajectory.

Object Properties related to Cruise:

hasTrajectory: Reflects the path taken by the cruise, comprising spatiotemporal segments. This property is crucial for understanding a cruise's spatial and temporal aspects, similar to how ""hasScheduler"" in GBO might relate to organizing or scheduling aspects of a cruise.
isPerformedBy, providesAgentRole: These properties link cruises to agents (individuals or organizations) and their roles, which could parallel the ""hasScheduler"" relationship in GBO that connects a cruise to an organizing entity.
Classes related to Cruise:

Agent, AgentRole: Represent individuals or organizations and their specific roles within a cruise context. These entities are part of the broader agent pattern reused across both ontologies, potentially aligning with how ""Cruise"" and ""hasScheduler"" in GBO involve scheduling entities.
Vessel, Trajectory, Segment, Fix, Port: These classes are part of the spatiotemporal modeling of cruises, where a vessel undertakes a trajectory comprised of segments and fixes, possibly including stops at ports. This detailed structure supports the understanding of a cruise as both a physical journey and an event, which might align with the general conceptualization of cruises in GBO.
Non-Spatiotemporal Information:

InformationObject, FundingAward, Program: These classes capture additional details about cruises, such as funding, programs associated with them, and other descriptive information. While not directly related to ""hasScheduler,"" these aspects contribute to a comprehensive view of cruises that could encompass organizational aspects in GBO.
The alignment between GMO's detailed approach to modeling cruises and the elements mentioned in your GBO ontology excerpt suggests a focus on both the event-like nature of cruises and their spatiotemporal dimensions. The GMO ontology seems to offer a more granular view, including trajectories and agent roles, which could complement the broader strokes of cruise organization and scheduling described in GBO.

Given this analysis, related pieces in GMO to the concepts of ""Cruise"" and ""hasScheduler"" in GBO would include the Cruise class as a subclass of Event, object properties like ""hasTrajectory,"" ""isPerformedBy,"" and ""providesAgentRole,"" along with classes such as ""Agent,"" ""AgentRole,"" ""Vessel,"" ""Trajectory,"" and ""InformationObject.""

It looks like we encountered another technical hiccup while trying to retrieve related pieces from the GMO ontology based on your GBO concepts. Given the specific nature of your request, it might involve detailed analysis and specific knowledge of both ontologies' structures and contents, which can be challenging to automate directly without a more tailored approach.

However, if you're looking for connections between concepts like ""Cruise"" or properties such as ""isSchedulerOf"" in the context of ontologies, a manual approach might be more effective. This could involve:

Identifying Key Concepts and Relationships: For each ontology, identify key classes, properties, and instances that are relevant to your domain of interest (e.g., maritime activities, scheduling).

Mapping Between Ontologies: Look for semantic similarities or potential alignments between the concepts in GMO and those in GBO. This might involve finding equivalent classes or properties, or identifying more complex relationships like subclass or subproperty hierarchies.

Leveraging Ontology Tools: There are tools and frameworks designed for ontology alignment, merging, and analysis that can help in identifying relationships between different ontologies. Tools like Protégé, with plugins for ontology alignment, might be useful.

Consulting Domain Experts: Insights from domain experts can be invaluable in understanding the nuances of how concepts in one ontology relate to those in another, especially in specialized domains.

The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The ontology aligns with several patterns, including Agent, Agent Role, Event, and Semantic Trajectory, indicating a multifaceted approach to representing cruises.

Given the complexity of the ontology and the error encountered earlier in directly querying the GMO ontology file, we'll approach the task of finding related pieces in GMO by identifying key concepts and object properties from the description that are likely to have counterparts or be relevant in the GMO context. These include:

Agent and Agent Role: These are fundamental to modeling the entities involved in a cruise and their roles. In GMO, look for classes and properties that deal with entities (human, organization) and their roles in maritime activities.

Event and Spatiotemporal Information: The ontology models cruises as events with spatiotemporal boundaries. In GMO, relevant parts would include classes and properties that describe events, especially those occurring in maritime contexts, and their spatiotemporal aspects.

Trajectory and Semantic Trajectory: The ontology emphasizes the trajectory of a cruise, modeled through fixes, segments, and associated spatial and temporal information. In GMO, seek parts that represent paths, routes, or journeys of vessels, including their spatiotemporal components.

Information Object: This aspect covers non-spatiotemporal information related to cruises, such as funding and programs. In GMO, relevant sections would involve how information about maritime activities is represented, including digital objects and documentation.

Physical Objects like Vessels and Ports: Given the ontology's focus on cruises involving vessels traversing through ports, in GMO, look for classes and properties that describe vessels, their movements, and interactions with ports.

To proceed without directly querying the GMO ontology file (due to the technical issue), these conceptual pointers serve as a guide for what related parts to look for within GMO. This involves manually inspecting the ontology for classes and properties that align with these concepts, using ontology editing and visualization tools such as Protégé. This approach should help identify relevant parts of GMO that correspond to or can be related to the described components of the Cruise micro-ontology.",FALSE,2/4,0.5,3/5,0.4,,,3/5,0.4,,,,,

The Cruise micro-ontology describes ocean science cruises. Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The GMO ontology offers a comprehensive framework for representing cruises, their trajectories, and the roles of agents (which could include technicians) within these cruises. Here are the related components and how they connect to your GBO concepts:

1. Cruise and its Representation as an Event
The GMO ontology treats a Cruise as a type of event, which is in alignment with how your GBO ontology might conceptualize a Cruise. This event-centric view incorporates both the spatiotemporal aspect of the cruise (its trajectory and duration) and the roles of agents involved in it. The Cruise class in GMO is a subclass of the Event class, indicating its nature as an event with a specific trajectory and involvement of agents.
2. Agent Roles in a Cruise
The GMO ontology's focus on agent roles (AgentRole class) within a cruise context closely relates to the hasTechnician relationship in your GBO ontology. In GMO, agent roles are defined to represent the different capacities in which individuals or organizations may participate in a cruise. This includes a variety of roles that agents can have, analogous to the hasTechnician object property in GBO, indicating a person fulfilling a technician role on a cruise.
3. Trajectory and Vessel
The trajectory of a cruise, represented through the Trajectory class and associated properties such as hasTrajectory, isTraversedBy (the vessel), and nextFix, mirrors the GBO ontology's emphasis on the physical path and the vessel undertaking the cruise. The notion of a cruise as a journey with a defined path through space, marked by a series of geographic locations (Fix), is central to both ontologies.
4. Information Object and Non-spatiotemporal Aspects
The InformationObject class in GMO captures non-spatiotemporal information relevant to a cruise, such as funding details, associated programs, and descriptions. This aspect, while not directly paralleled in your brief GBO ontology excerpt, suggests a framework for incorporating detailed metadata about cruises, potentially including technical specifications or roles related to the cruise, akin to the technical details that a hasTechnician relationship might encompass.
5. Object Properties for Relationships and Roles
Several object properties in GMO, such as providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, and others that link agents, their roles, and the events (cruises) they are involved in, reflect the kind of relationships you are modeling in GBO with hasTechnician. These properties define how individuals or entities are connected to specific cruises and the roles they play.
In summary, the GMO ontology provides a detailed framework for modeling cruises as complex events involving various agents and their roles, set within specific spatiotemporal contexts. This closely aligns with the concepts of Cruise and hasTechnician in your GBO ontology, particularly in the areas of event modeling, role assignment, and the trajectory of a cruise.",FALSE,4/4,1,2/6,0.6666666667,,,2/6,0.6666666667,,,,,

Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered a technical hiccup while trying to process the GMO ontology file and find related pieces to the GBO ontology you mentioned. This issue is preventing me from directly accessing and analyzing the content of the GMO ontology as intended.

Given this limitation, I can offer a general approach on how to manually identify related parts between two ontologies such as GMO and GBO:

Identify Key Concepts: Start by identifying the key concepts in GBO that you're interested in, which you've already done with ""Cruise"" and ""isTechnicianOf"".

Search for Semantic Similarities: Look for classes or properties in GMO that are semantically related to these concepts. For ""Cruise"", you might look for terms related to travel, vessels, or events. For ""isTechnicianOf"", you might look for properties that denote employment or roles within an event or organization.

Compare Definitions and Hierarchies: Check the definitions (comments) and hierarchies (subclass or subproperty relationships) in GMO for matches or closely related concepts to those in GBO.

Use Ontology Tools: Utilize ontology editors and tools like Protégé, which can help in searching and exploring ontologies for specific classes, properties, or relationships that match or are related to your terms of interest.

Look for Ontology Mappings: In some cases, ontologies might have mappings between them, especially if they're in related domains. These mappings can provide direct links between concepts in different ontologies.

If you have specific parts of the GMO ontology in mind or can provide more details about what constitutes a ""related"" piece in this context, I could offer more targeted advice.

Intuitively, the notion of ocean science cruise is rather too specific since one can obviously also think of sight-seeing cruises, pleasure cruises, or even science cruises which are not used for ocean science purposes. In this context, to develop a pat- tern that is highly reusable, the generic notion of cruise would be a better candidate than ocean science cruise. However, for the purpose of the project, rather than developing such a pattern, we opt to consider Cruise as a micro-ontology obtained by combining and reusing existing patterns. This is done through established modeling practices while keeping the amount of abstract ontological commitments to a mini- mum. An earlier version of this chapter with a bit more detail can be found in a separate technical report [Krisnadhi et al., 2014].
Figure 13.1 illustrates a general overview of the Cruise micro-ontology. As seen in the figure, the speci- fication of the Cruise micro-ontology can be dissected into three parts. First, a cruise is an abstraction of a path/route undertaken by a vessel, which is a physical object, through space within a certain time duration. This is captured by modeling a cruise to have exactly one trajectory, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel. Second, a cruise can be understood as an event, which provides role performed by agents, pertaining activities conducted in/during a cruise. Our modeling of event through the Event pat- tern in Chapter 3 views events as something that not only provide roles to agents, but also occurs within some spatiotemporal boundary. Consequently, the first and second parts mentioned earlier can be together seen as a kind of complicated event. In fact, both the first and second parts motivate the alignment with the Agent pattern of Chapter 1, Agent Role pattern of Chapter 2, and obviously, the Event pattern. Alignment with the Event pattern is in particular rather complicated since the spatiotemporal information of a cruise is implicitly given by its associated trajectory. Trajectory for a cruise and modeling a cruise 
Next, for the third part, we understand that a cruise may have other, non-spatiotemporal information relevant to it. For instance, information about funding awards that fund it, or programs associated with it. This is modeled by reusing the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. Note that every information object can be realized by a number of information realization, which includes digital objects (papers, re- ports, etc.) about the cruise. All the above modeling choices allows us to distinguish a cruise from both the information object that describes it and the physical object, i.e., vessel, by which it is undertaken.
In using this Cruise micro-ontology, one at least needs to specify different types of agent-roles relevant for populating cruise with data. These types of agent-roles, however, should not be considered part of the core modeling of Cruise because their specification essentially does not change the meaning of “cruise” according to Figure 13.1 above. Intuitively, these types of agent-roles could be better understood as part of nomenclature that data providers use. Nomenclature would be more easily changed. For agent-role types, this implies that we can add as many new agent-role types as we want in the future, and since these addition should not change the meaning of “cruise”, it makese sense to have them separate from the core part of Cruise micro-ontology. We will discuss this in Section 
13.1.2 Cruise as Event: Trajectory and Agent Roles for Cruise
We model a cruise as a type of event. The spatiotemporal dimension of cruise as an event is represented by its trajectory as given by Figure 13.2, while the involvement of agent in a cruise is represented by agent-roles that is performed by agents, e.g., humans or organizations. More specifically, a cruise may provide an agent role, which is performed by an agent. This is represented by the AgentRole and Agent class with specific nomenclature for agent-roles are explained in Section 13.2. These entities are aligned to the analogous entities in the Event pattern from Chapter 3, the Agent Role pattern from Chapter 2, and the Agent pattern from Chapter 1. In addition, the alignment of the Cruise micro-ontology with the Event pattern assert that the Cruise class is as a subclass of the Event class.
which already provides basic vocabulary and OWL axiomatization [Hu et al., 2013]1 to model cruise tra- jectory. The multi-granularity of that pattern accommodates the modeling of the (geospatial) path traveled by the vessel of the cruise and with some extension to the vocabulary, it can also be used to model certain meaningful notions and landmarks, such as the port sequence, port stops, arrival and departure times, etc.
According to the Semantic Trajectory pattern, a trajectory is given by a collection of fixes, representing time-stamped locations. Non-spatiotemporal information specific to a fix can be included by assigning it some attributes, for example, to indicate that the fix is the arrival to some port stop. The ordering of the fixes is based on their temporal information. Between two consecutive fixes, we can define a segment, which is traversed by some moving object. There is no requirement forcing that all segments in the trajectory can only be traversed by the same moving object. Furthermore, the Semantic Trajectory pattern can also include information about the source of the spatiotemporal information of a fix, such as GPS sensors.
The Semantic Trajectory pattern is a very generic pattern. To fit our needs, we make a number of adjust- ments.
(i) WeintroducethePortclassassubclassofPlace,whichcanthenbeusedtoannotatethosespecialfixes.
(ii) Since a cruise is undertaken by no more than one vessel, we remodel the isTraversedBy property to be entailed by a property chain. This is to ensure that if a trajectory is traveled by a vessel, all of the
trajectory’s segment is also traversed by the same vessel.
(iii) WeomitthepartofSemanticTrajectorypatternthatallowsustoincludeinformationaboutthesource,
e.g., GPS sensors, that establish fixes because they appear to be irrelevant our current project, at least at the current stage. It is of course possible that this can be included in future version of this micro- ontology, and in fact, it is straightforward to do so.
(iv) The Semantic Trajectory pattern models the ordering of fixes by assuming that two fixes and a seg- ment are predefined, and then entailing the actual ordering as nextFix relation from them. In our case, the data typically already contains ordering of fixes, i.e., the nextFix relation is explicit in the data, and thus, segments are auto-instantiated from it. This is motivated by real scenarios whereby indeed only properties of fixes will often be known, in particular their locations, and temporal extension, whether they are at ports, whether they are arrival or departure fixes from ports, and in which sequence the fixes occurred. The traversing vessel will usually also be known. However, trajectory segments to which the trajectory pattern attaches information about the vessel are usually not explicitly repre- sented in the data.
All the above consideration are depicted in Figure 13.2 and imply that we cannot reuse the whole OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013] for our needs here. We thus present in Section 13.3 our version of the OWL axiomatization for modeling trajectory which, for the sake of completeness, will also repeat the necessary parts of the OWL axiomatization from [Hu et al., 2013].
Note from Figure 13.2 that the trajectory of a cruise clearly contains spatiotemporal information that is relevant for understanding a cruise as an event. Intuitively, a cruise as an event occurs at places given by the whole route it takes according to its trajectory. In particular, the ports where a cruise stops is a place at which a cruise as event occurs. Similar consideration can also be made for the temporal information. These spatiotemporal information are, however, buried deep within the trajectory and necessitate a rather complicated alignment with the Event pattern.
We now explain Figure 13.2 in the following. Here, a cruise has exactly one trajectory and is undertaken by exactly one vessel. The trajectory of each cruise has at least two distinct fixes, one represents the starting fix, and the other represents the ending fix. Each of those fixes that is not the ending fix connects to exactly one other fix via the nextFix property, while the ending fix itself connects to no other fix in the trajectory. This provides us with the ordering of fixes. Each fix has some location and time information and may have some attributes. Particular attributes include port_stop_arrival and port_stop_departure. The former indicates that the corresponding fix represents the arrival to a port stop in the trajectory, while the latter represents the departure from a port stop. The location of a fix is a spatial footprint of some place of interest. In particular, if the location of a fix corresponds to some port, we also directly connect the fix with the port through the atPort property. The trajectory also has at least one segment. Each of those segments is auto-generated from two consecutive fixes and is traversed by the vessel by which the cruise is undertaken. A segment may also have some attributes, if necessary.
Following Figure 13.3, we associate each instance of Cruise with exactly one InformationObject, which is aligned to the analogous class in the Information Object pattern from Chapter 4. This InformationObject acts as a proxy through which we describe various information about the cruise not covered by having the cruise as an event. In addition to the data properties inherited from the Information Object pattern, which includes identifier, description, webpage, etc., an InformationObject of a cruise may have information regarding funding award, program, as well as other cruises related to the cruise described by this instance of InformationObject.
Nomenclature for cruise includes types of cruises, types of agent-roles for cruises, and attributes for fixes in the trajectory of a cruise. In the current version, cruise types are given as subclass of Cruise in Figure 13.4. Agent roles for cruises are given in Figure 13.5, while attributes of the fixes of the cruise are given in Figure 13.6. These terms are defined within the Cruise pattern’s URI namespace, but will be declared in a separate OWL file. This implies that the types of these agent-roles are really specific for the Cruise pattern. That is, for example, if there is a scientist role in a different pattern, then that is really a different role than the scientist role in the Cruise pattern. Finally, we model operational cruises by asserting that a cruise is operational, if and only if it has a chief scientist and is funded by some funding award.

The detailed description mentions several key elements:

Trajectory and Spatiotemporal Aspects: The notion that a cruise involves a trajectory through space within a certain time duration, consisting of spatiotemporal segments traversed by a vessel, aligns with the concepts of trajectories, spatial footprints, places, and time entities. Look for classes and properties in GMO related to trajectories, spatial and temporal representation (such as locations, times, paths, and segments), and moving objects.

Agent Roles and Events: The description underscores cruises as events that provide roles to agents (e.g., humans, organizations) and occur within spatiotemporal boundaries. In GMO, related aspects would involve classes and properties that model events, agents, agent roles, and activities conducted during such events.

Information Object and Non-spatiotemporal Information: The discussion about information objects representing non-spatiotemporal information relevant to a cruise, like funding awards or programs associated with it, suggests looking for GMO entities related to information representation, documentation, and associated entities like funding and program representation.

Given these aspects, let's identify related entities within the GMO ontology that correspond to these concepts. This involves looking for:

Classes and properties related to spatial and temporal modeling, such as Trajectory, TimeEntity, Place, and their related properties (hasLocation, atTime, hasTrajectory, etc.).
Entities pertaining to events and agent roles, which could include Event, Agent, AgentRole, and properties linking agents to their roles and events (providesAgentRole, isPerformedBy, etc.).
Information-related classes and properties, like InformationObject, Program, FundingAward, and properties that describe or link to these information aspects.
Given the error encountered with direct ontology processing, I'll outline a hypothetical approach to finding related entities, as direct inspection of the GMO ontology file isn't possible in this interaction:

For Trajectories and Spatiotemporal Modeling: Search for entities in GMO that deal with the representation of movement, locations, and temporal aspects. This includes any class or property related to paths, movements, locations, times, and their relationships.

For Agent Roles and Events: Look for any mention of events, participants in those events, and the roles they might play. This could be directly named as such or could involve similar terminology, depending on how broadly or specifically ""agent"" and ""event"" are defined in GMO.

For Information Objects and Related Aspects: Identify any classes or properties that are used to represent information, documentation, and associations with programs or funding. This could include generic classes for representing documents or data, as well as more specific properties linking cruises to their informational descriptors.

Without directly querying the GMO ontology, these guidelines can help navigate the ontology with an ontology editor or through SPARQL queries to find entities that match or relate to the concepts described in the Cruise micro-ontology.",FALSE,3/4,0.75,3/6,0.5,,,3/6,0.5,,,,,

Some of the axioms relevant to the cruise trajectory are obtained by reusing, with some modifications, the axioms of from Semantic Trajectory pattern [Hu et al., 2013]. For clarity and completeness, we will restate those axioms here as needed.
We begin describing the cruise trajectory by defining its basic components: fixes and segments. A fix has a location and a time stamp, and always belongs to one particular trajectory. Also, a fix cannot be followed by more than one other fix, and cannot follow itself. This gives a linear structure in the ordering of the fixes.
Fix ⊑ ∃hasLocation.Position ⊓ ∃atTime.TimeEntity ⊓ (=1 hasFix−.Trajectory) Fix ⊑ (61 nextFix.Fix) ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.Self
We next define starting and ending fixes as special kinds of fixes.
StartingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix−.⊤ EndingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.⊤
StartingFix ⊓ EndingFix ⊑ ⊥
A trajectory is linked to at least two consecutive fixes where the first fix is the starting fix. Also,
belongs to a trajectory, then its successor fix also belongs to the same trajectory.
Trajectory ⊑ ∃hasFix.(StartingFix ⊓ ∃nextFix.Fix) hasFix ◦ nextFix ⊑ hasFix
(13.14) (13.15)
(13.16) (13.17) (13.18)
if a fix
(13.19) (13.20)
A segment starts from exactly one fix, and for every fix with a successor fix, there is a segment that starts from it. If a fix belongs to a trajectory and there is a segment that starts from this fix, then the segment belongs to the trajectory. Furthermore, if a segment starts from a fix, then it ends at the successor of the fix.
Segment ⊑ (=1 startsFrom.Fix) ∃nextFix.Fix ⊑ (=1 startsFrom−.Segment)
hasFix ◦ startsFrom− ⊑ hasSegment startsFrom ◦ nextFix ⊑ endsAt
(13.21) (13.22)
(13.23) (13.24)
The above axiomatization ensures that a trajectory is linked to all of its fixes and segments. Note that the above axioms do not model a trajectory to have a finite sequence of fixes of unknown length, which cannot actually be modeled in OWL 2. In our case, however, data providers will only provide cruise trajectory as a finite collection of fixes with a known ordering, which can be written as a set of ABox axioms of the form Fix(f1), . . . , Fix(fn), nextFix(f1, f2), . . . , nextFix(fn−1, fn), StartingFix(f1), EndingFix(fn). Since a fix cannot have more than one successor fix, we implicitly obtain a finite, linear ordering given by the transitive closure of nextFix.
We next define atPort as a shortcut via property chain involving hasLocation and hasSpatialFootprint, which can be written in Datalog as: hasLocation(x, y), hasSpatialFootprint(z, y), Port(z) → atPort(x, z). The following two axioms express the rule where rollifiedPort is a fresh property name defined solely for the class Port, which is defined as a subclass of Place.
hasLocation ◦ hasSpatialFootprint− ◦ rollifiedPort ⊑ atPort ∃rollifiedPort.Self ≡ Port
Port ⊑ Place
We assert that a cruise is an event through the alignment with Event pattern (see Section 13.4.3). We then assert that a cruise has exactly one trajectory, is undertaken by exactly one vessel, and is described by exactly one InformationObject. Additionally, this instance of InformationObject describes exactly only the cruise. We also assert that if a cruise is undertaken by a vessel, then the trajectory of the cruise has to be traveled by the vessel.

Note that since isTraveledBy is implied by a property chain, OWL 2 specification forbids us to express a cardinality restriction using this peroperty. Consequently, we cannot axiomatize that the trajectory of a cruise can only be traveled by one vessel. Next, we state the guarded domain and range restrictions for the properties mentioned above.

(13.10)","Based on the detailed axioms you've provided for the GMO ontology, which focuses on maritime cruises, their trajectories, and related components, here's how these concepts might relate to the ""PortCall"" entity in your GBO ontology:

Fixes and Segments Relating to Port Calls: In the context of the GMO ontology, ""Fixes"" represent specific locations (and times) along a cruise trajectory, and ""Segments"" are the paths between these fixes. A ""PortCall"" could be directly associated with ""StartingFix"" and ""EndingFix"" as these special kinds of fixes denote significant points in a voyage, potentially corresponding to ports where a vessel might start or end its journey, or transfer passengers and goods.

atPort Property for Identifying Port Calls: The ""atPort"" shortcut property, defined through a chain involving ""hasLocation"" and ""hasSpatialFootprint"" (and further connected to a ""Port""), is explicitly relevant to identifying instances where a vessel is at a port. This directly relates to the concept of a ""PortCall"" as it signifies a vessel's presence at a specific port, which is central to the idea of a port call in the GBO ontology.

Cruise and Vessel Relation to Port Calls: The definition of a ""Cruise"" as an event that is undertaken by exactly one vessel and has a precise trajectory aligns with the circumstances under which port calls occur. A ""PortCall"" could be seen as an event within the broader context of a cruise's journey, marked by the cruise's arrival at and departure from a port, involving the vessel that undertakes the cruise.

Trajectory and Port Calls: The trajectory of a cruise, composed of fixes and segments, and defined to belong to at least one cruise event, underpins the entire journey that includes port calls. The trajectory's start and end points (and potentially other significant points marked by fixes) can denote port calls, especially when these points correspond to locations with port facilities.

InformationObject and Port Calls: The fact that a cruise is described by exactly one ""InformationObject"" could imply that details of port calls (as significant events during the cruise) are captured within this descriptive entity. This alignment suggests that information pertaining to port calls, such as timings, activities, and involved entities (like passengers and goods), could be structured within the broader informational framework that describes the cruise.

In summary, the GMO ontology's concepts of fixes (especially ""StartingFix"" and ""EndingFix""), segments, the ""atPort"" property, and the overarching framework of cruises, vessels, and their trajectories, offer a rich context for modeling and understanding port calls within the maritime domain. These elements provide a structural and semantic foundation that can align with and extend to the ""PortCall"" concept defined in your GBO ontology.",FALSE,1/1,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

It seems I'm unable to directly read and analyze the content of the GMO ontology file due to a technical issue. Without directly accessing the file's content, I can't specifically identify the pieces in the GMO ontology that directly relate to your GBO ontology details.

However, I can offer a general approach to how you might find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the triples from the GBO ontology you provided:

Identify Key Concepts and Properties: In your GBO ontology, the key concepts are ""PortCall"" and ""Place"", and the key property is ""atPort"". Look for similar or related concepts in the GMO ontology.

Search for Object Properties: The GBO ontology mentions ""atPort"" as an object property with an inverse of ""isPortOf"". Look for any object properties in the GMO ontology that have similar domain and range, or that are described as inverses of each other.

Domain and Range Matching: The GBO ontology specifies ""PortCall"" as the domain and ""Place"" as the range for ""atPort"". In the GMO ontology, look for properties with similar domain and range definitions.

Check for Comments and Labels: The comment in the GBO ontology provides context about the ""atPort"" property's role. Similar comments or labels in the GMO ontology might hint at related concepts or properties.

InverseOf Relationships: Since ""atPort"" is an inverse of ""isPortOf"", search the GMO ontology for properties that are defined as inverses, which could indicate a similar relational structure.

For a more precise matching, it would be necessary to directly analyze the GMO ontology's content.

∃isDescribedBy.InformationObject ⊑ Cruise","Given the detailed information about the GMO ontology and your query about how it relates to gbo:atPort, let's establish a connection based on the provided description.

The gbo:atPort(x, y) relationship in the GBO ontology implies a connection between a PortCall and a Place, where x is a PortCall and y is a Place. The description from GMO you've provided outlines how trajectories, fixes, segments, and the properties that connect these concepts are modeled. The key part that relates to gbo:atPort is the description of atPort within GMO, which is explained through a property chain: hasLocation ◦ hasSpatialFootprint− ◦ rollifiedPort ⊑ atPort.

Here's how these components relate to gbo:atPort:

Trajectories and Fixes: The basic components of cruise trajectories in GMO include fixes (points with a location and a timestamp) and segments (paths between fixes). These components could be analogous to the concept of a PortCall in GBO if we consider a PortCall as a specific type of location or event in a cruise's journey.

Property Chains for atPort: The most direct connection to gbo:atPort is the GMO property chain definition: hasLocation(x, y), hasSpatialFootprint(z, y), Port(z) → atPort(x, z). This suggests that in GMO, the atPort relationship can be derived from the location of a fix (hasLocation) and a spatial footprint that connects to a port (hasSpatialFootprint), with the port being a subclass of Place. This mechanism is used to associate a trajectory fix (or a segment of a cruise's journey) with a port, which is conceptually similar to how gbo:atPort associates a PortCall with a Place.

Port as a Subclass of Place: The statement Port ⊑ Place in GMO aligns directly with the range of gbo:atPort, which is main:Place. This indicates that the notion of ports in GMO is consistent with the use of places in GBO, providing a semantic link between the two ontologies through their categorization of ports/places.

Cruise, Trajectory, and Vessel: The broader context in which these components interact (i.e., a cruise having a trajectory, undertaken by a vessel, and described by an information object) doesn't directly relate to gbo:atPort, but it sets the stage for understanding how locations (such as ports) are integral to defining the semantics of a cruise's journey in the GMO ontology.

In summary, the direct relationship to gbo:atPort in the GMO ontology is found in the definition of atPort as a derived property through a property chain that connects fixes (and their locations) to ports, thereby establishing a connection between a trajectory's specific location and a port. This is conceptually similar to the gbo:atPort property's role in linking a PortCall to a Place.",FALSE,1/1,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

It looks like I'm encountering an issue with processing the GMO ontology in relation to the ""isPortOf"" property from the GBO ontology. This could be due to a variety of technical reasons. However, I can guide you on how you might approach this task manually or with another tool:

Identify Similar Properties: Look for properties in GMO that have similar names or labels to ""isPortOf"". This could involve searching for properties related to ports, connections, or associations between entities.

Check for Object Properties: Since ""isPortOf"" is an object property in GBO, similar object properties in GMO would be relevant. You would look for properties defined with rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty.

Examine Domain and Range: For any properties you identify as potentially related, check their domain and range definitions. Similarities in these areas might indicate a relevant connection to ""isPortOf"".

Look for Equivalent Properties: The GMO ontology might explicitly define some properties as equivalent to ""isPortOf"" using owl:equivalentProperty.

Search for Sub-properties: Properties in GMO that are sub-properties (rdfs:subPropertyOf) of a similar concept might also be relevant.

For a more detailed analysis, using software that can handle RDF and OWL ontologies, like Protégé, could be very helpful. Protégé allows you to visually navigate and query ontologies, making it easier to find related concepts and properties. ​​","User

Some of the axioms relevant to the cruise trajectory are obtained by reusing, with some modifications, the axioms of from Semantic Trajectory pattern [Hu et al., 2013]. For clarity and completeness, we will restate those axioms here as needed.
We begin describing the cruise trajectory by defining its basic components: fixes and segments. A fix has a location and a time stamp, and always belongs to one particular trajectory. Also, a fix cannot be followed by more than one other fix, and cannot follow itself. This gives a linear structure in the ordering of the fixes.
Fix ⊑ ∃hasLocation.Position ⊓ ∃atTime.TimeEntity ⊓ (=1 hasFix−.Trajectory) Fix ⊑ (61 nextFix.Fix) ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.Self
We next define starting and ending fixes as special kinds of fixes.
StartingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix−.⊤ EndingFix ≡ Fix ⊓ ¬∃nextFix.⊤
StartingFix ⊓ EndingFix ⊑ ⊥
A trajectory is linked to at least two consecutive fixes where the first fix is the starting fix. Also,
belongs to a trajectory, then its successor fix also belongs to the same trajectory.
Trajectory ⊑ ∃hasFix.(StartingFix ⊓ ∃nextFix.Fix) hasFix ◦ nextFix ⊑ hasFix

if a fix
A segment starts from exactly one fix, and for every fix with a successor fix, there is a segment that starts from it. If a fix belongs to a trajectory and there is a segment that starts from this fix, then the segment belongs to the trajectory. Furthermore, if a segment starts from a fix, then it ends at the successor of the fix.
Segment ⊑ (=1 startsFrom.Fix) ∃nextFix.Fix ⊑ (=1 startsFrom−.Segment)
hasFix ◦ startsFrom− ⊑ hasSegment startsFrom ◦ nextFix ⊑ endsAt

The above axiomatization ensures that a trajectory is linked to all of its fixes and segments. Note that the above axioms do not model a trajectory to have a finite sequence of fixes of unknown length, which cannot actually be modeled in OWL 2. In our case, however, data providers will only provide cruise trajectory as a finite collection of fixes with a known ordering, which can be written as a set of ABox axioms of the form Fix(f1), . . . , Fix(fn), nextFix(f1, f2), . . . , nextFix(fn−1, fn), StartingFix(f1), EndingFix(fn). Since a fix cannot have more than one successor fix, we implicitly obtain a finite, linear ordering given by the transitive closure of nextFix.
We next define atPort as a shortcut via property chain involving hasLocation and hasSpatialFootprint, which can be written in Datalog as: hasLocation(x, y), hasSpatialFootprint(z, y), Port(z) → atPort(x, z). The following two axioms express the rule where rollifiedPort is a fresh property name defined solely for the class Port, which is defined as a subclass of Place.
hasLocation ◦ hasSpatialFootprint− ◦ rollifiedPort ⊑ atPort ∃rollifiedPort.Self ≡ Port
Port ⊑ Place
We assert that a cruise is an event through the alignment with Event pattern (see Section 13.4.3). We then assert that a cruise has exactly one trajectory, is undertaken by exactly one vessel, and is described by exactly one InformationObject. Additionally, this instance of InformationObject describes exactly only the cruise. We also assert that if a cruise is undertaken by a vessel, then the trajectory of the cruise has to be traveled by the vessel.
Cruise ⊑ (=1 hasTrajectory.Trajectory)
Cruise ⊑ (=1 isUndertakenBy.Vessel)
Cruise ⊑ (=1 isDescribedBy.InformationObject)
InformationObject ⊑ (=1 isDescribedBy−.Cruise) hasTrajectory− ◦ isUndertakenBy ⊑ isTraveledBy
Note that since isTraveledBy is implied by a property chain, OWL 2 specification forbids us to express a cardinality restriction using this peroperty. Consequently, we cannot axiomatize that the trajectory of a cruise can only be traveled by one vessel. Next, we state the guarded domain and range restrictions for the properties mentioned above.

Cruise ⊑ ∀hasTrajectory.Trajectory
∃isUndertakenBy.Vessel ⊑ Cruise

∃isDescribedBy.InformationObject ⊑ Cruise""","Based on the detailed description of the GMO ontology you've provided, relating to cruise trajectories, including concepts like fixes, segments, trajectories, and properties like hasLocation, atTime, nextFix, startsFrom, endsAt, hasSegment, and isTraveledBy, let's explore how these might relate to the isPortOf property from the GBO ontology.

The isPortOf property in GBO seems to imply a relationship between an entity and a port, suggesting that the entity is located at or associated with a particular port. In the context of the GMO ontology, several pieces might be conceptually related to this idea, especially those involving locations and spatial relationships.

hasLocation and atPort: These properties are directly related to the concept of being at a specific location, which is the essence of the isPortOf relationship. The atPort shortcut, which involves hasLocation and hasSpatialFootprint, closely mirrors the isPortOf relationship by defining a connection between an entity (like a fix or a cruise) and a port.

Port and Place: The ontology defines Port as a subclass of Place, which would be relevant in understanding the types of locations involved in isPortOf. Any entity defined or related to Port in GMO could be considered as potentially being on the ""port side"" of the isPortOf relationship.

Property Chains Involving Locations and Ports: The use of property chains, such as hasLocation ◦ hasSpatialFootprint− ◦ rollifiedPort ⊑ atPort, suggests complex relationships between entities and their locations, specifically linking to ports. This aligns with the idea behind isPortOf of linking entities to ports but with a more specific pathway (through locations and spatial footprints).

Trajectory-Related Concepts: The detailed modeling of trajectories, including their components (fixes, segments) and properties (startsFrom, nextFix, endsAt, hasSegment), provides a structure for understanding movement and location over time. While not directly analogous to isPortOf, these concepts underlie the conditions in which an entity might come to be at a port or leave from one, engaging in the broader narrative of port-related activities.

Cruise and Vessel Relationships: The ontology's attention to cruises, vessels, and their trajectories (isUndertakenBy, hasTrajectory, isTraveledBy) highlights the entities likely to engage in isPortOf relationships. Understanding how cruises are linked to trajectories and vessels can inform on how the broader concept of being ""at a port"" is modeled within GMO.

These pieces of the GMO ontology don't map one-to-one with isPortOf but rather provide a framework for understanding how entities are located and move in relation to ports, which is conceptually related to the isPortOf relationship in GBO.",FALSE,1/1,1,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample.

PhysicalSample Class: Central to the model, representing physical objects that are sampled, either from the field or derived from other samples in a laboratory setting. This aligns directly with the GBO's notion of a PhysicalSample as an ""object of observation.""

SamplingProcess Class: Represents the method or event by which a PhysicalSample is derived. This could include fieldwork or laboratory processes, and it's modeled as a subclass of an Event, which includes temporal and spatial attributes, as well as associated agents.

Feature Class: A broader category from which PhysicalSample is derived, indicating that every PhysicalSample is a type of Feature, but with additional specificities that make it a distinct class.

InformationObject Class: Provides additional descriptive information about a PhysicalSample, such as names, IDs, and other metadata that could correspond to the IGSN metadata schema referenced in the GBO ontology.

Property Class: Describes attributes of a PhysicalSample, such as material type, age, etc., reflecting the detailed nature of sample information that needs to be captured.

Object Properties:

originatesFrom: Links a PhysicalSample back to its source Feature.
isInputFeatureOf: Indicates the feature that serves as input to a SamplingProcess.
derivedUsing: Connects a PhysicalSample to the SamplingProcess it was derived from.
isDescribedBy: Links a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject for additional metadata.
hasProperty: Associates a PhysicalSample with its Property(ies) to describe specific attributes.

However, we can still proceed by discussing the key elements you've mentioned in the GBO ontology and how you might find related pieces in the GMO ontology or any other ontology.

main:hasSampleType is an object property that:
is the inverse of main:isSampleTypeOf,
has a domain of main:PhysicalSample, and
has a range of main:PhysicalSampleType,

Equivalent or related object properties: Look for properties in GMO that serve a similar role to hasSampleType, especially those related to the classification or categorization of samples.
Inverse relationships: Search for properties that are defined as inverses of ones related to sample type categorization.
Domain and range similarities: Identify classes in GMO that correspond to PhysicalSample and PhysicalSampleType from GBO. This might include looking for classes that represent physical entities or categorizations thereof.
Label and naming conventions: Sometimes, related concepts can be identified by similar naming conventions or labels, even across different ontologies.

In the GMO ontology, several components closely relate to the concepts involved in hasSampleType from GBO:

ecglps:PhysicalSample: This class in GMO is analogous to the GBO's PhysicalSample. It represents the physical samples in detail, including their generation from a sampling process, whether in the field or a laboratory.

Object Properties Related to PhysicalSample:

ecglps:originatesFrom: This property could be considered when looking for relations akin to hasSampleType, especially regarding the origin or type of the sample.
ecglps:derivedUsing: This indicates a sample's derivation from a sampling process, analogous to specifying a sample's type in terms of its method of acquisition or creation.
ecglps:isDescribedBy: This can link a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject that might include type-related information, akin to a sample type in GBO.
ecglps:hasProperty: It could relate to specific characteristics or classifications of the sample, somewhat parallel to the sample type concept.
Classes Involved in Sampling:

ecglps:SamplingProcess: Directly related to the generation of PhysicalSamples, this could encompass types of sampling methods akin to differentiating sample types in GBO.
ecglps:Feature: As the superclass of PhysicalSample, it provides a broad categorization that could include various types of samples.
Logical Axioms and Relationships:

The axioms you described, such as the requirement for a PhysicalSample to originate from a Feature and to be derived using a SamplingProcess, add constraints that define the nature and classification of samples in a way that could be analogous to hasSampleType.
Given the parallel structures and concepts, the ecglps:PhysicalSample class in GMO directly correlates to GBO's PhysicalSample. Object properties like ecglps:originatesFrom, ecglps:derivedUsing, ecglps:isDescribedBy, and ecglps:hasProperty in GMO are relevant to the concept of hasSampleType in GBO by defining how samples are classified, originated, and described, offering a detailed framework for understanding the relationships and classifications of samples in a similar manner to hasSampleType.",TRUE,0/1,0,0,1,Type(),,0,1,,,,,

Error analyzing
It appears we're encountering technical difficulties with processing the GMO ontology file to find pieces related to the isSampleTypeOf property from the GBO ontology. This could be due to several factors, such as file format issues, compatibility, or limitations within the current environment.

While I'm unable to directly parse and analyze the ontology file at this moment, we can discuss general strategies to identify related parts between two ontologies:

Semantic Similarity: Look for properties or classes in the GMO ontology that semantically relate to ""isSampleTypeOf"". This could involve properties related to sample types, categorization, or association between entities.

Label and Comment Inspection: Sometimes, relationships between entities in different ontologies are hinted at through labels (rdfs:label) or comments (rdfs:comment). Inspecting these annotations for mentions of sample types or related concepts could be useful.

Equivalent and Sub-Properties: In OWL, properties can be related through owl:equivalentProperty or hierarchical relationships (rdfs:subPropertyOf). Check if isSampleTypeOf or a similar property in GBO has an equivalent or is a sub-property of another property in GMO.

Manual Mapping: In cases where automated methods are challenging, manual inspection and mapping based on domain knowledge might be necessary. This involves analyzing the definitions and usage of properties and classes in both ontologies to identify potential relations.

For more detailed analysis or assistance, it might be helpful to use ontology editing and analysis tools like Protégé, which provide a graphical interface for exploring and editing ontologies, and could offer more insights into the relationships between different ontological entities.

Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, particularly focusing on the ""Physical Sample"" pattern, it's clear that the ontology models the domain of physical samples, their derivation process, and their characteristics in detail. This pattern and its components offer a rich context for identifying related pieces to the gbo:isSampleTypeOf property from the GBO ontology.

The gbo:isSampleTypeOf(x, y) property in GBO seems to imply a relationship where x is a type of sample that pertains or belongs to y. To find a parallel or related concept within the GMO ontology, we'd look for object properties and classes that describe a similar relationship of belonging or derivation between samples and their source or type.

From the description of the GMO ontology, several elements appear to be conceptually similar to or could serve roles related to gbo:isSampleTypeOf:

ecglps:originatesFrom: This object property indicates that a PhysicalSample originates from some Feature. This seems closely related to isSampleTypeOf in that it specifies a source or type from which the sample comes. In the context of GMO, if y can be understood as a Feature, and x as a PhysicalSample, then ecglps:originatesFrom represents a similar relational concept.

ecglps:derivedUsing: The relationship between a PhysicalSample and a SamplingProcess through derivedUsing highlights the process by which a sample is derived. Though more process-oriented, it does indicate a type or category of derivation that might be of interest when considering the types of relationships embodied by isSampleTypeOf.

Classes: The classes ecglps:PhysicalSample, ecglps:SamplingProcess, and ecglps:Feature provide a structural framework that supports these relationships. Particularly, ecglps:PhysicalSample being a subclass of Feature and the axioms involving derivation and origin suggest a schema wherein the types and sources of samples are explicitly modeled.

In summary, the ecglps:originatesFrom property seems to be the most direct parallel to gbo:isSampleTypeOf within the information provided. It explicitly models a relationship between samples and their sources or types, akin to the role of isSampleTypeOf in linking sample entities to their categorization or source entities in GBO. This mapping between concepts in GBO and GMO could facilitate interoperability and understanding across these ontologies, especially in domains concerned with the provenance, categorization, and processing of physical samples.",FALSE,1/2,0.5,3/4,0.25,,,3/4,0.25,,,,,

However, typically, to find elements in the GMO ontology that relate to parts of the GBO ontology like PhysicalSample and hasCollector, you would:

Look for Classes Similar to PhysicalSample: Identify any classes in the GMO ontology that are used to represent physical objects or samples that can be collected, observed, or preserved.
Examine Object Properties: Search for object properties that resemble hasCollector, focusing on those that link physical objects or samples to entities like persons or collectors. This includes properties that indicate who collected a sample or who is associated with it in some capacity.
Review Comments and Labels: Pay attention to comments (rdfs:comment) and labels (rdfs:label) within the GMO ontology that mention terms like ""sample,"" ""collector,"" or related concepts. These can provide hints about the ontology's structure and how it models similar ideas.
Analyze Domain and Range: For object properties, analyze their domain (rdfs:domain) and range (rdfs:range) definitions. Properties in the GMO ontology that have a domain of physical samples or similar entities and a range of persons (or similar roles) could be analogous to hasCollector.
Check for Inverse Properties: If the GMO ontology defines inverse properties (using owl:inverseOf), look for any that might be inversely related to a property similar to hasCollector.

GBO's PhysicalSample to GMO's ecglps:PhysicalSample:
The GMO ontology's ecglps:PhysicalSample class directly corresponds to the GBO's PhysicalSample class. In GMO, a PhysicalSample is a subclass of ecglps:Feature, indicating it is a specialized form of a feature, much like how GBO describes it as an object that can be preserved or catalogued. This alignment with the concept of deriving a physical sample through a sampling process or from fieldwork parallels the description provided for GBO.
Relation to Collectors (gbo:hasCollector(x, z)):
While the provided GMO information does not explicitly mention a collector role, the GMO ontology describes a SamplingProcess class and various object properties like ecglps:originatesFrom, ecglps:isInputFeatureOf, ecglps:derivedUsing, and ecglps:isDescribedBy that could implicitly involve a collector. Specifically, a collector's role might align with agents involved in the SamplingProcess (a subclass of Event with agents, timestamps, and places) since collectors are typically agents who collect or derive samples. Therefore, the process involving SamplingProcess and properties like ecglps:derivedUsing could be analogous to the hasCollector relationship in the context of identifying who or what process collected the sample.
GMO Classes and Object Properties Related to Sampling and Description:
ecglps:SamplingProcess: Corresponds to the process by which a PhysicalSample is generated, including fieldwork or laboratory sampling. This class plays a central role in modeling how samples are collected or derived, which is implicitly related to the concept of a collector in GBO.
ecglps:Feature and ecglps:PhysicalSample: The hierarchy where a PhysicalSample is a subclass of Feature aligns with the GBO idea of a physical sample being a specific object of observation.
Object Properties: Properties such as ecglps:isDescribedBy (linking to ecglps:InformationObject for additional information like name and ID) and ecglps:hasProperty (linking to properties of the sample, such as material type and age) are essential for describing and managing the metadata of physical samples, similar to the descriptive elements highlighted in GBO.
This comparison highlights the GMO ontology's approach to modeling physical samples and related processes, offering parallels to the GBO ontology's treatment of PhysicalSample and its collection.

Based on the information provided about the GBO ontology's handling of PhysicalSample and its relation with the isCollectorOf property, and comparing this with the detailed module information from the GMO ontology, we can identify related parts in the GMO ontology that align with the concepts and relationships described in GBO. The description you've provided for GBO outlines a framework for managing data about physical samples, including their derivation, properties, and the processes involved in their collection and analysis.

For the GMO ontology, the key elements that might relate to GBO's PhysicalSample and the isCollectorOf relationship can be deduced from the conceptual overlap in handling samples, their properties, and the processes associated with their collection or derivation. The detailed information about the GMO ontology module provided hints at several parallels:

PhysicalSample Class: In GMO, if there's a class similar to ecglps:PhysicalSample, it would be a direct counterpart to GBO's PhysicalSample. This class would be involved in representing physical objects that are collected or observed for scientific purposes, potentially within the context of genetic modifications.
SamplingProcess and Event: The SamplingProcess in GMO, a subclass of Event, which involves timestamps, places, and agents, mirrors the GBO's description of how a PhysicalSample is derived. Any classes or properties in GMO that describe the process of sampling, including temporal and spatial attributes, as well as the entities involved, would be relevant.
Feature and InformationObject Classes: In GBO, PhysicalSample is a subclass of Feature, and described by InformationObject, providing a structural and descriptive framework for samples. Similarly, in GMO, any classes that serve as a basis for physical samples and offer additional descriptive information (like ID, name, or other metadata) would relate to this aspect of GBO.
ObjectProperties: The object properties mentioned (e.g., originatesFrom, isInputFeatureOf, derivedUsing, isDescribedBy, hasProperty) in the GMO ontology suggest mechanisms for relating samples to their origins, features, processes of derivation, descriptions, and properties. These directly correspond to the relational aspects described in GBO, especially the isCollectorOf relationship, which implies a connection between an agent and a sample.
Given these elements, the related parts in the GMO ontology to look for would include:

Any classes specifically named or conceptually equivalent to PhysicalSample, potentially with a focus on genetically modified organisms.
Properties and processes related to the collection, derivation, and description of samples, which could include object properties similar to those mentioned (like those handling derivation, description, and property annotation).
The conceptual framework for organizing information about samples, including how they're derived, their features, and the metadata associated with them.
These parallels offer a foundation for understanding how GMO might relate to GBO's handling of PhysicalSample and the isCollectorOf property. Identifying exact matches or closely related elements within the GMO ontology would require an analysis of the ontology's structure and content, potentially using tools or queries designed to explore RDF or OWL ontologies.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,4/5,0.2,,,4/5,0.2,,,,,

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth.

Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, the parts that relate to the GBO ontology's concepts of PhysicalSample and hasContact can be identified from the description and structure you've shared. Here's a breakdown of the relevant components in GMO that align with the GBO concepts:

GBO to GMO Mapping
GBO:PhysicalSample:
GMO Equivalent: ecglps:PhysicalSample
The GMO PhysicalSample is defined as a subclass of Feature, similar to the GBO description. It's modeled to represent data about physical samples like sections, wedges, and other types, clearly distinguishing it from statistical samples. This directly aligns with the GBO concept of a physical sample that can be preserved, catalogued, and has metadata aligned with the IGSN schema.
GBO:hasContact (x, z):
GMO Equivalent: While there isn't a direct equivalent named ""hasContact"" in the provided GMO information, the GMO ontology introduces several object properties that relate to the interactions or relationships between entities (samples, processes, etc.) which might conceptually align with the idea of ""contact"" in a broader sense.
ecglps:originatesFrom: Could conceptually relate to how a sample or entity comes into contact with its source or origin.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: Indicates a relationship where a PhysicalSample (or Feature) is an input to a SamplingProcess, which might align with the concept of contact through involvement in a process.
ecglps:derivedUsing: Relates a PhysicalSample to a SamplingProcess, indicating how one sample is derived from another or a feature, possibly aligning with the concept of contact through derivation.
ecglps:isDescribedBy: Links a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject, which could align with the concept of having contact in the sense of documentation or metadata description.
ecglps:hasProperty: Indicates that a PhysicalSample has certain properties, which, while not directly related to ""contact"" in the interpersonal or organizational sense, relates to how samples are characterized and catalogued.
Additional Alignment
The GMO ontology's focus on the process (e.g., SamplingProcess as a subclass of Event) and the inclusion of InformationObject and Property classes for additional metadata and characteristics provide a comprehensive framework for modeling physical samples and their relationships, similar to the intent described in GBO.

This alignment suggests that the GMO ontology offers a detailed model for representing physical samples, their derivation, characterization, and documentation processes, which corresponds well with the objectives and entities described in the GBO ontology.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,3/4,0.25,,,3/4,0.25,,,,,

Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology, the related pieces to the GBO concepts of ""PhysicalSample"" and the relationship ""isContactOf"" can be discerned as follows:

PhysicalSample: In both GMO and GBO, ""PhysicalSample"" is a core concept but utilized differently. In GBO, it's an object of observation that may be cataloged or preserved, while in GMO, it extends to include details about the sample's acquisition, whether through fieldwork or derived from another sample in a laboratory setting. The GMO ontology explicitly defines ""PhysicalSample"" as a subclass of ""Feature,"" indicating its origin and derivation process.
Related Object Properties:
ecglps:originatesFrom: This property might relate to how a ""PhysicalSample"" in GBO is associated with its origins or sources, akin to the ""hasContact"" property that links a sample to its relevant contacts or origins.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: This could parallel how a ""PhysicalSample"" in GBO is connected to various processes or entities, possibly aligning with how samples are part of broader studies or investigations.
ecglps:derivedUsing: Directly corresponds to the process of generating a ""PhysicalSample"" in GMO, through a ""SamplingProcess,"" which might relate to the GBO's conceptualization of how physical samples are preserved and cataloged.
ecglps:isDescribedBy and ecglps:hasProperty: These properties are used to describe additional information about a ""PhysicalSample"" in GMO, similar to how GBO might use relationships to detail a sample's metadata (e.g., cataloging information, preservation details).
Related Classes:
ecglps:SamplingProcess: A subclass of ""Event"" in GMO, indicating the process through which a ""PhysicalSample"" is derived, closely aligning with the description of ""PhysicalSample"" generation in GBO.
ecglps:Feature and ecglps:PhysicalSample: Indicate the hierarchical structure in GMO where a ""PhysicalSample"" is a specific type of ""Feature,"" potentially analogous to GBO's treatment of ""PhysicalSample"" as a distinct observational object.

Although I can't directly examine the file due to this hiccup, we can still discuss a general approach you might use to find related pieces in the GMO ontology based on the GBO ontology segments you've provided.

General Approach to Find Related Pieces in Ontologies
Identify Key Concepts and Properties:
From your GBO segments, the key concepts are PhysicalSample and the relationship hasContributor (and its inverse isContributorOf). Identify similar concepts in GMO, such as classes or properties related to physical samples or contribution.
Search for Semantic Similarities:
Use tools or manual inspection to search the GMO ontology for classes or properties with names or descriptions that resemble ""physical sample"" or ""contributor."" This can involve searching for specific keywords or using semantic similarity tools.
Examine Relationships:
Look for properties in GMO that define relationships similar to hasContributor, especially those indicating a contribution relationship. Pay attention to the domain and range of these properties to ensure they match the context of physical samples or similar entities.
Review Documentation or Metadata:
If available, review any documentation or metadata associated with the GMO ontology. It might provide insights into the ontology's structure or highlight related concepts.
Use Ontology Tools:
Consider using ontology management tools like Protégé or WebVOWL to visually explore the GMO ontology. These tools can help identify related classes and properties by visualizing the ontology's structure.
Leverage SPARQL Queries:
If you're familiar with SPARQL, you can write queries to programmatically search for related concepts in the GMO ontology. For example, you can query for classes related to physical samples or properties indicating a contribution relationship.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify related pieces in the GMO ontology. If you can share more specific details or concepts you're interested in within the GMO ontology, I can provide more directed advice. ​","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:hasContributor(x, z) ↔

Here’s how the elements in GMO relate to those in GBO:

GBO to GMO Mapping
GBO PhysicalSample Class:
In GBO, PhysicalSample is described as an object of observation that can be preserved, cataloged, and corresponds to certain metadata schemas.
GMO Equivalent: The ecglps:PhysicalSample class in GMO is designed to model data about physical samples, differentiating it from statistical samples. It includes details about the sample generation process, whether acquired directly from the field or through a laboratory sampling process. This class is a subclass of Feature, allowing a physical sample to be derived from another physical sample or the original feature, closely aligning with the GBO concept of a physical sample.
GBO hasContributor Property:
In GBO, hasContributor is an object property that indicates a contribution relationship to a dataset, digital object, or physical sample.
GMO Related Concepts:
While the specific hasContributor property isn't explicitly mentioned in your GMO summary, the concept of contribution is indirectly present through the modeling of the sampling process and the relationships between samples, features, and properties. The SamplingProcess class, being a subclass of Event, includes agents (which could be interpreted as contributors in this context) involved in the process.
The properties like ecglps:originatesFrom, ecglps:isInputFeatureOf, ecglps:derivedUsing, and ecglps:isDescribedBy in GMO suggest a structured approach to describing how physical samples are generated, described, and characterized, which includes the involvement of various agents (potentially akin to contributors in GBO).
Summary
While the GMO ontology's detailed description doesn't directly mention a property equivalent to hasContributor, the inclusion of agents in the sampling process and the detailed modeling of how physical samples are generated, described, and related to other entities suggest a framework where contributions by individuals or entities could be identified or inferred, especially in the context of SamplingProcess and its subclass relationship with Event.

The key points from your description highlight:

PhysicalSample as a Class: Modeled similarly to GBO's PhysicalSample, which is a subclass of Feature and can be derived from another PhysicalSample or the original Feature. It suggests looking for a class hierarchy involving samples, features, and derivation processes in GMO.
SamplingProcess as a Class: This class, being a subclass of Event, includes properties like timestamps, places, and agents, aligning with the isContributorOf relationship in GBO by involving agents in the process.
ObjectProperties: Such as originatesFrom, isInputFeatureOf, derivedUsing, isDescribedBy, and hasProperty. These properties suggest relationships between samples, features, and additional metadata that may parallel the isContributorOf concept in GBO, which implies contribution or involvement in the sample's generation or description.
Related Classes: Including Feature, InformationObject, and Property. These indicate a focus on the metadata, physical characteristics, and the broader context of samples, potentially aligning with how GBO views PhysicalSample and its connections to other entities.
To extract similar parts from GMO that are related to these descriptions and the gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:isContributorOf(x, z) construct:

Search for Classes and Subclasses: Look for the PhysicalSample, Feature, and any related subclass structures within GMO that match the hierarchy described.
Object Properties Analysis: Identify object properties in GMO that facilitate the relationships between PhysicalSample and other entities, especially those that indicate a derivation process, contribution by agents, or descriptions of samples.
Event and Process Modeling: Find how events or processes (similar to SamplingProcess) are modeled, particularly those involving physical samples and their characteristics.

Class: ecglps:PhysicalSample

ObjectProperty: ecglps:isDescribedBy
While not a direct match to gbo:hasCurator, this property implies a relationship where a PhysicalSample is associated with descriptive metadata, akin to how a curator would be associated with a physical sample in GBO.

Class: ecglps:SamplingProcess
Relevant to the creation and processing of a PhysicalSample, this could correlate to aspects of the curator's role in managing or overseeing the sampling process, even though it doesn’t directly map to hasCurator.
ObjectProperty: ecglps:derivedUsing
This property indicates the process through which a PhysicalSample is derived, potentially involving oversight or execution by a curator-like role, thereby providing an indirect connection to the gbo:hasCurator relationship.
Class: ecglps:InformationObject
This could potentially include information about the curator as part of the descriptive metadata for a PhysicalSample, providing a more indirect link to the curator concept.

ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: This indicates a relationship where a PhysicalSample serves as input for a process, possibly managed or overseen by a curator.

ecglps:isDescribedBy: This property links a PhysicalSample to its descriptive metadata, similar to a curator's role in cataloging and providing information about an item.
ecglps:hasProperty: This could relate to the curatorial task of documenting and maintaining records of a sample's characteristics, such as material type, age, etc.

PhysicalSample and its relationships: In GMO, ecglps:PhysicalSample is defined with a rich context that distinguishes it from statistical samples. It is specifically noted to be a subclass of ecglps:Feature, indicating that every PhysicalSample is also considered a Feature. This aligns closely with the GBO's PhysicalSample, especially in the emphasis on physical samples being differentiated from abstract or statistical samples and being tied to physical processes and properties.
Object Properties related to PhysicalSample:
ecglps:originatesFrom: Could relate to the conceptual lineage of a sample, akin to GBO's concern with the editing or curation of a sample.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: This highlights the role of a PhysicalSample in broader processes, possibly analogous to being managed or edited within a dataset.
ecglps:derivedUsing: Indicates a process (such as a SamplingProcess) used to derive a sample, which could be relevant if gbo:hasEditor concerns the processes involving samples.
ecglps:isDescribedBy: Relates a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject, which could encompass editorial metadata in a similar vein to GBO's hasEditor.
ecglps:hasProperty: Directly connects a PhysicalSample to its properties, which might include editorial information in a broad sense.
Classes related to PhysicalSample:
ecglps:SamplingProcess and ecglps:Feature: Indicate the broader ontological context within which PhysicalSample is situated, emphasizing process and attribution, which might indirectly relate to editorial oversight or curation.
Given this alignment, we can see that while GMO and GBO may use different terminologies or emphases, they share a conceptual framework centered around the detailed modeling of physical samples, their properties, derivation processes, and documentation. The specific connection to gbo:hasEditor would likely be metaphorically akin to the roles that manage or curate samples within GMO, such as through the isDescribedBy or derivedUsing properties, suggesting a focus on the provenance, curation, and detailed characterization of physical samples.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,2/4,0.5,,,2/4,0.5,,,,,

GBO:PhysicalSample:
In GMO, the PhysicalSample is a specific instantiation of a more general concept of a sample, differentiated from statistical samples. It's defined as a subclass of Feature, indicating its role as an observable or measurable piece of the physical world. This aligns with the GBO description of a PhysicalSample as an object of observation that can be preserved or catalogued. The GMO ontology describes the PhysicalSample in a similar context but with a focus on its derivation from a SamplingProcess and its connection to features, events, and properties.
GBO:isEditorOf:
While the provided GMO excerpt does not explicitly mention an isEditorOf object property or a similar concept relating to editorial roles, it does describe various object properties that relate to the process and provenance of a PhysicalSample. The closest GMO analogs would involve properties that describe how a PhysicalSample is derived, described, and categorized, such as originatesFrom, isInputFeatureOf, derivedUsing, isDescribedBy, and hasProperty.
Given these descriptions, the related parts in GMO to gbo:PhysicalSample and gbo:isEditorOf can be summarized as follows:

Related to gbo:PhysicalSample:
ecglps:PhysicalSample: Directly correlates with gbo:PhysicalSample by focusing on the physical aspect and observable characteristics of samples.
ecglps:Feature: As a superclass of PhysicalSample, it represents the observable characteristics from which PhysicalSample is derived.
ecglps:SamplingProcess: Models the process by which a PhysicalSample is generated, aligning with the idea of acquiring or deriving physical samples mentioned in GBO.
Related to gbo:isEditorOf:
Although there's no direct counterpart to isEditorOf focusing on editorial roles, the GMO ontology includes several object properties that describe the relationships and processes involved in the generation, description, and characterization of PhysicalSamples, such as:
ecglps:originatesFrom
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf
ecglps:derivedUsing
ecglps:isDescribedBy
ecglps:hasProperty

In the GMO ontology, the PhysicalSample pattern is detailed with several key aspects:

Class: ecglps:PhysicalSample
This class represents physical samples in the GMO ontology, which is analogous to gbo:PhysicalSample. It's specifically differentiated from statistical samples and can include various sample types like sections, wedges, etc. It's defined as a subclass of ecglps:Feature, indicating it inherits properties that pertain to a broader concept of features within the domain.
Object Properties Related to PhysicalSample:
ecglps:originatesFrom: This property could relate to how a PhysicalSample is connected to its origin, which might be akin to how gbo:hasRegistrant connects a sample to a person or entity in GBO.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: Indicates the relationship between a PhysicalSample (or more broadly, a Feature) and processes it is part of, which could parallel the idea of a registrant being responsible for a sample.
ecglps:derivedUsing: Links a PhysicalSample to the SamplingProcess used to derive it. This relationship underscores the generation process of samples, which could be indirectly related to the concept of registration or ownership in the GBO ontology.
ecglps:isDescribedBy: Connects a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject providing additional details, potentially analogous to how a registrant’s information might be linked to a sample in GBO.
ecglps:hasProperty: Associates a PhysicalSample with its properties, such as material type or age. This is slightly tangential but shows the depth of information that can be associated with samples, similar to the registrant’s role in documenting sample details in GBO.
Class: ecglps:SamplingProcess
Defined as a subclass of Event, this class details the process by which a PhysicalSample is derived, including methods and contexts of acquisition. The SamplingProcess encompasses aspects like timestamps, place, and agents involved, which could correlate with the gbo:hasRegistrant property in terms of delineating responsibility and process.
Other Related Classes:
ecglps:Feature: The broader category from which PhysicalSample is derived, signifying the sample's role as a feature within a larger context.
ecglps:InformationObject: Provides descriptive information about a PhysicalSample, which can include identifiers like name or ID, akin to the details a registrant might provide in GBO.
ecglps:Property: Details the specific properties of a PhysicalSample, such as material type or age, further enriching the sample's documentation and potentially relating to the registrant's role in GBO.
This comparison suggests that the GMO ontology provides a comprehensive framework for modeling physical samples, including their origin, properties, descriptive metadata, and the processes involved in their derivation.

The description of GMO's Physical Sample pattern and its components gives us a comprehensive view of how physical samples are represented, including the processes involved in their generation and the properties associated with them. Here’s how these components correlate:

PhysicalSample Class (GBO ↔ GMO):
In both GBO and GMO, PhysicalSample is a key class. The GMO ontology specifically mentions it as a subclass of Feature, emphasizing its role in representing physical objects that can be observed and cataloged, much like the GBO description.
Relationship to Other Entities (GBO ↔ GMO):
The GBO relationship isRegistrantOf can be conceptually mapped to several object properties in GMO, particularly those that define how a PhysicalSample is related to other entities:
ecglps:originatesFrom could relate to the source or origin of the sample.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf might relate to how the sample serves as an input to a process, similar to being the registrant (or primary entity involved) in a process.
ecglps:derivedUsing closely aligns with the process of generating a sample, potentially analogous to registration in the context of tracking sample origin and transformations.
Classes and Properties (GMO specific details):
ecglps:SamplingProcess: This class is central to understanding how a PhysicalSample is obtained, either from fieldwork or as a derivative in a laboratory setting, which complements the isRegistrantOf relationship by detailing the procedural context.
ecglps:Feature and ecglps:PhysicalSample: The distinction between a PhysicalSample and its source Feature provides a foundation for tracing sample lineage, similar to the registry aspect of isRegistrantOf.
ecglps:InformationObject: This class describes a PhysicalSample with metadata like name and ID, which is crucial for cataloging and registration purposes.
ecglps:Property: Reflecting the characteristics of a sample, such as material type and age, which are essential aspects of its registration and identification.

Error analyzing

It seems I encountered an unexpected issue trying to read the file. Instead of attempting to directly read the contents again, I'll proceed by discussing how you can identify related pieces in your GMO ontology based on the description of the GBO ontology you provided.

The GBO ontology describes a PhysicalSample class with a specific purpose and metadata schema reference, and a hasRightsHolder object property that connects various types of resources to their rights holders, which could be organizations or persons.

To find related pieces in the GMO ontology, you would look for:

Classes similar to PhysicalSample: Search for classes that are described as physical objects, samples, or any resource that can be observed, preserved, and cataloged. The description provided in GBO highlights the importance of preservation and metadata schema adherence, so any class with similar characteristics in GMO would be relevant.
Object properties akin to hasRightsHolder: Look for object properties that establish ownership, rights, or responsibilities over resources. This includes properties that link resources (like datasets, digital objects, documents, or samples) to entities such as organizations or individuals. The object property may not have the exact name but look for properties with similar domain and range specifications.
Metadata schema references: If the GMO ontology includes references to external metadata schemas (like the IGSN metadata schema mentioned in GBO), those parts of the ontology are likely related to the management, description, and identification of samples or resources.
Inverse properties and domain/range specifications: Similar to hasRightsHolder and its inverse isRightsHolderOf, look for properties in GMO that have explicitly defined inverse relationships or detailed domain and range specifications that align with those in GBO.
Unfortunately, without direct access to the GMO ontology contents at this moment, these guidelines are the best approach to manually inspect the GMO file for related elements.

Class: ecglps:Property","Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology and its relation to the gbo:PhysicalSample and gbo:hasRightsHolder, we can identify several related components within the GMO that align with these concepts from the GBO ontology. The description outlines a detailed model surrounding physical samples, their derivation, properties, and associated processes.

Related to gbo:PhysicalSample
Class: ecglps:PhysicalSample: Directly corresponds to gbo:PhysicalSample, focusing on physical objects that can be observed, preserved, and cataloged. It is differentiated from statistical samples and is tied to the physical world, capable of being derived from other samples or features.
Class: ecglps:SamplingProcess: Related to the process through which a PhysicalSample is generated, either through field work or a laboratory process. This highlights a procedural linkage that could be similar to how rights holders might be involved in the process of sample collection or generation in the GBO context.
Class: ecglps:Feature: As PhysicalSample is a subclass of Feature, this represents the broader category from which physical samples can be derived, aligning with the idea of an observable object in GBO.
Related to gbo:hasRightsHolder
Given that gbo:hasRightsHolder connects resources to their rights holders (organizations or individuals), we would look for properties in GMO that establish a relationship between a physical sample (or its derivatives) and entities or agents responsible for or associated with it. While the provided GMO details don't explicitly mention rights holders, the following properties and classes could be conceptually related:

ObjectProperty: ecglps:derivedUsing: This property could imply a connection between a sample and the process (or agent involved in the process) that derived it, which may encompass rights or ownership implications indirectly.
ObjectProperty: ecglps:isDescribedBy: Links a PhysicalSample to an InformationObject that provides additional details. If the information object includes rights or custodial information, this property could serve a similar function to gbo:hasRightsHolder.
Class: ecglps:InformationObject: While primarily for additional information about a sample, if this includes metadata on rights or custodianship, it could relate to the concept of rights holders in GBO.
Summary
The direct correlation in GMO to gbo:PhysicalSample is found in the ecglps:PhysicalSample class, with associated processes and features that provide a rich model for understanding physical samples' origins, properties, and descriptions. Although the explicit concept of a rights holder as seen in GBO isn't directly mentioned in the provided GMO details, properties linking samples to descriptive metadata or derivation processes could conceptually touch upon ownership or rights, especially if the associated metadata includes such information.

To establish a more precise alignment or find direct equivalents to gbo:hasRightsHolder in GMO, one would need to explore whether any of the described properties or additional ones not listed explicitly connect physical samples to entities with rights or ownership, possibly through indirect means such as the process of creation, description, or property attribution.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,3/4,0.25,,,3/4,0.25,,,,,

Error analyzing
It seems I'm encountering an issue with processing the file you've provided, preventing me from directly querying the GMO ontology for related concepts to the GBO ontology you mentioned. This might be due to a specific handling or parsing error within the environment I'm using.

Given these challenges, there are a few alternative approaches we can take:

Manual Inspection: If the GMO ontology file isn't too large or complex, you might be able to manually inspect it for classes or properties related to PhysicalSample or isRegistrantOf. This could involve searching for terms related to samples, registration, or any metadata descriptors that align with the GBO ontology descriptions.
Semantic Relationships: If there are known semantic relationships or patterns in how the ontologies are structured, identifying connections between PhysicalSample or isRegistrantOf and their equivalents in the GMO ontology could be guided by these patterns. For example, you might look for properties or classes that deal with samples, registration, or cataloging in the GMO ontology.
Consult Documentation or Community Resources: If the GMO ontology is part of a larger project or community effort, there might be documentation or forums where you can get insights into how it relates to concepts in the GBO ontology.
Ontology Editing Tools: Tools like Protégé or WebVOWL could be helpful for visually inspecting the GMO ontology and finding related concepts. These tools offer graphical representations of ontologies, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different entities.

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

To still provide you with helpful insight, let's discuss a general approach you could take to compare and find related parts between two ontologies, like GBO and GMO:

Identify Object Properties: You'd want to look for object properties in GMO that are analogous or have a similar role to main:originatesFrom in GBO. This involves comparing their domains and ranges to see if they align or overlap in any way.
Examine Class Hierarchies: Since main:PhysicalSample and main:Feature are mentioned as domain and range in GBO, identifying classes within GMO that serve similar purposes or are in some way related to these concepts would be crucial. This could involve looking at subclasses or superclasses of related concepts.
Domain and Range Compatibility: For any object property in GMO similar to main:originatesFrom, check if its domain and range are compatible or can be related to main:PhysicalSample, main:Feature, or their equivalents in GMO. This could include looking for properties that have a domain or range of a class that is equivalent to or a superclass/subclass of these GBO classes.
Semantic Similarity: Beyond structural similarity, considering the semantic context of the properties and classes might reveal connections not immediately obvious through structural analysis alone.
Without direct access to process the GMO ontology due to the encountered issue, these steps are a starting point for manually comparing the ontologies or attempting the comparison with different tools or methods.

Firstly, we define that a PhysicalSample should be originated from some Feature. ∃originatesFrom.Feature ⊑ PhysicalSample
PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀originatesFrom.Feature
A PhysicalSample should also be derived from a SamplingProcess. Thus, we have the following axioms.
∃derivedUsing.SamplingProcess ⊑ PhysicalSample PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀derivedUsing.SamplingProcess
A SamplingProcess has exactly an input Feature, and should derive an output PhysicalSample. SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)isInputFeatureOf−.Feature
SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)derivedUsing−.PhysicalSample A PhysicalSample is a subclass of a Feature which is a subclass of things.
PhysicalSample ⊑ Feature Feature ⊑ ⊤
When a Feature is the input feature of a SamplingProcess which derive another PhysicalSample, we say the PhysicalSample originates from the Feature.
derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom (16.9)
A PhysicalSample can have InformationObject which provides additional information about the PhysicalSample. Similarly, it can also have Property to describe some attributes, such as material type, color, age, and so forth.

Object Properties:
ecglps:originatesFrom: Directly related to gbo:originatesFrom. In GMO, this property links a PhysicalSample to its origin Feature, analogous to how originatesFrom functions in GBO, connecting a sample to either a Feature or another PhysicalSample.
ecglps:derivedUsing: This property indicates that a PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess, aligning with the notion in GBO where a physical sample or feature can be the result of some process.
ecglps:isInputFeatureOf: Specifies that a Feature is an input to a SamplingProcess, complementing the derivedUsing property by detailing the process of deriving new samples from existing features or samples.
Classes:
ecglps:PhysicalSample: Equivalent to main:PhysicalSample in GBO, representing the concept of a physical sample that is distinct from a statistical sample and can be derived from either a feature or another physical sample.
ecglps:SamplingProcess: A class that models the process through which a physical sample is derived, analogous to any process in GBO that might result in a sample being obtained from a feature.
ecglps:Feature: This class is the basis for the originatesFrom relationship, serving as either the origin point for a physical sample or as a component involved in the sampling process. It's a superclass of PhysicalSample, indicating that all physical samples are, by definition, features.
Axioms and Relationships:
The axioms defining the relationships between PhysicalSample, SamplingProcess, and Feature mirror the structure you're looking at in GBO. They specify how samples originate from features, how samples can be derived from other samples or features through processes, and how these entities are interconnected.
Additional Concepts:
ecglps:isDescribedBy and ecglps:hasProperty indicate how a PhysicalSample is related to InformationObject and Property, respectively, providing a way to describe additional information and attributes about samples, akin to metadata and characteristics in GBO.

PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀hasProperty.Property""","Given the detailed description of the GMO ontology's Physical Sample pattern, we can draw parallels to the GBO's isOriginOf property through the relationships and entities described in GMO. Here's how these concepts relate:

ObjectProperty ecglps:originatesFrom:
Directly corresponds to GBO's isOriginOf. In GMO, originatesFrom is used to indicate the source feature from which a physical sample is derived. This is similar to how isOriginOf would be used in GBO, implying a relationship where one entity (the sample) originates from another (the source feature).
Classes and Their Relationships:
PhysicalSample: As a subclass of Feature, it aligns with the GBO concept where an entity (the physical sample) can be an origin of or originated from another entity (feature). This could be seen as analogous to the entities participating in the isOriginOf/originatesFrom relationship in GBO.
SamplingProcess: Modeled as a subclass of Event, it's involved in the derivation of a PhysicalSample. This could correlate with the process aspect of how something comes to be the origin of something else in GBO, especially considering the derivedUsing property.
Core Axioms:
The axioms provided, such as ∃originatesFrom.Feature ⊑ PhysicalSample, establish that a PhysicalSample must originate from some Feature, which directly relates to the GBO concept of isOriginOf. The axiom derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom specifically illustrates a complex relationship that ties the concept of origin to the process of sampling and the features involved, closely mirroring the essence of isOriginOf.
Properties ecglps:derivedUsing, ecglps:isInputFeatureOf, ecglps:isDescribedBy, and ecglps:hasProperty:
While not directly analogous to isOriginOf, these properties contribute to the overall narrative of a PhysicalSample's origin and characteristics. They outline the process of derivation (how one entity gives rise to another through a process), input features (the source entity), and descriptions/properties (additional information about the entity), all of which enrich the understanding of an entity's origin in a broad sense.
In summary, the ecglps:originatesFrom property in GMO is the direct counterpart to GBO's isOriginOf. The described classes, their relationships, and the core axioms in GMO provide a comprehensive framework that reflects the concept of origination, akin to what isOriginOf represents in GBO, including the processes and entities involved.",FALSE,1/4,0.25,1/3,0.6666666667,,,1/3,0.6666666667,,,,,

Error analyzing
It seems there was a misunderstanding on my end regarding accessing the content of the GMO ontology file. Instead of directly reading its content as I intended, let's approach this differently.

Given the structure of the GBO ontology you provided, specifically the concepts of PhysicalSample and originatesFrom, I can guide you on how to search for related parts in the GMO ontology based on common ontology design principles. Unfortunately, without direct access to the content, I can't provide specific matches or references within the GMO ontology. Here's a general strategy you can follow:

Search for Equivalent or Similar Classes: Look for classes in the GMO ontology that serve a similar purpose or have a similar definition to PhysicalSample. This might be classes related to biological or environmental samples, observations, or specimens.
Inspect Object Properties: Look for object properties in GMO that mirror the relationship described by originatesFrom in GBO. This involves properties that link samples to their origin, be it a geographical feature, a biological entity, or another sample. Pay special attention to the domain and range of these properties to ensure they align with those in GBO.
Look for Shared Vocabulary: Sometimes, ontologies covering similar domains might use shared or overlapping vocabularies. Check if the GMO ontology references IGSN (International Geo Sample Number) or similar standards. This could indicate areas of overlap.
Review Documentation and Metadata: If the GMO ontology includes comments or metadata similar to the description of PhysicalSample in GBO, it could help identify related parts. This information might be in the ontology headers, class annotations, or property descriptions.
Explore Hierarchies: Examine the class and property hierarchies within the GMO ontology for elements that are positioned similarly to PhysicalSample and originatesFrom within GBO. This can reveal structural similarities between the two ontologies.
To proceed effectively, you would need to use an ontology editor or viewer like Protégé, or perform text searches within the GMO ontology file for these key aspects. If you have specific terms or concepts from GMO that you're curious about, feel free to share them for more directed advice. ​","Given this below information about GMO, can you give me related pieces in GMO that are related to gbo:PhysicalSample(x) ∧ gbo:originatesFrom(x, z) ∧ gbo:PhysicalSample(z) →

The Physical Sample pattern is designed to model data about samples, such as section, wedge, as well as other types of samples. By naming the pattern as PhysicalSample, we differentiate it from the general concept of sample from statistics. This pattern also models the process in which a physical sample is generated: it can be directly acquired from field work, but can also be obtained through some sampling process in a laboratory, in which a new (and possibly smaller) sample is derived from the original (and possibly bigger) sample. A PhysicalSample is derived using a SamplingProcess which should have an input Feature. In this pattern, we define the class PhysicalSample as a sub class of Feature, and as a result, a PhysicalSample can be derived from not only the original Feature but also another PhysicalSample. The SamplingProcess has been modeled as a sub class of Event which has timestamps, place, as well as agents (see the alignment to the Event pattern). A PhysicalSample is described by an InformationObject which provides additional information, such as name, ID, and so forth. A PhysicalSample also has its Property, such as material type, age, and so forth.

16.2.2 Core Axioms
Firstly, we define that a PhysicalSample should be originated from some Feature. ∃originatesFrom.Feature ⊑ PhysicalSample
PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀originatesFrom.Feature
A PhysicalSample should also be derived from a SamplingProcess. Thus, we have the following axioms.
∃derivedUsing.SamplingProcess ⊑ PhysicalSample PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀derivedUsing.SamplingProcess
A SamplingProcess has exactly an input Feature, and should derive an output PhysicalSample. SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)isInputFeatureOf−.Feature
SamplingProcess ⊑ (= 1)derivedUsing−.PhysicalSample A PhysicalSample is a subclass of a Feature which is a subclass of things.
PhysicalSample ⊑ Feature Feature ⊑ ⊤
When a Feature is the input feature of a SamplingProcess which derive another PhysicalSample, we say the PhysicalSample originates from the Feature.
derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom (16.9)
A PhysicalSample can have InformationObject which provides additional information about the PhysicalSample. Similarly, it can also have Property to describe some attributes, such as material type, color, age, and so forth.
PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀hasProperty.Property""","Based on the detailed description of the GMO ontology's treatment of physical samples, the following parts are directly related to the GBO ontology's PhysicalSample and the originatesFrom property, along with the concept of a physical sample being potentially a PhysicalSample itself:

Class: ecglps:PhysicalSample
This class in the GMO ontology corresponds to main:PhysicalSample in GBO. It represents physical samples in a similar way, emphasizing that these are distinct from statistical samples and can be derived from both original features and other physical samples.
ObjectProperty: ecglps:originatesFrom
Similar to main:originatesFrom in GBO, this property in GMO links a PhysicalSample to its source, which could be a Feature or another PhysicalSample. This captures the same relationship as the GBO ontology, where a physical sample originates from either a feature or another physical sample.
Class: ecglps:Feature
Corresponding to the range of originatesFrom in GBO, this class in GMO is used to represent the origin of a PhysicalSample. The definition in GMO further supports the idea that a PhysicalSample can originate from a Feature, aligning with the GBO concept.
Class: ecglps:SamplingProcess
This class models the process through which a PhysicalSample is derived, either from field work or as a new sample from an existing one in a laboratory. The relationship between SamplingProcess and PhysicalSample reflects the axiom in GBO regarding the derivation of one physical sample from another.
ObjectProperty: ecglps:derivedUsing
This property links a PhysicalSample to the SamplingProcess from which it is derived, paralleling the concept in GBO where a physical sample can originate from another through some process.
Core Axioms and Relationships
The axioms described in the GMO ontology, such as a PhysicalSample originating from a Feature, being derived through a SamplingProcess, and potentially being a subclass of Feature, align with the logical structures involving PhysicalSample and originatesFrom in GBO.
ObjectProperty: ecglps:isDescribedBy and ecglps:hasProperty
These properties allow for the description of a PhysicalSample with additional information and attributes, similar to how PhysicalSample in GBO might be linked to descriptive elements or properties.
This analysis highlights the parallel structures and concepts between the GMO and GBO ontologies concerning physical samples, their origins, and processes of derivation. The specific classes and properties identified in GMO mirror the logical constructs used in GBO, facilitating a conceptual bridge between these two domain ontologies.",FALSE,2/4,0.5,0,1,,,0,1,,,,,

can you give me pieces in gmo that are related to these parts in gbo?","To find the pieces in the GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) ontology that are related to the parts you've provided in the GBO (let's assume it stands for something like ""Genomic Bioinformatics Ontology,"" given the context, though the exact meaning might vary), we need to identify common themes or links based on the descriptions and relationships you've given from GBO:

PhysicalSample: This class is described as an object of observation that can be preserved, catalogued, and possibly related to the IGSN metadata schema. In the context of GMO, we might look for classes or entities that represent physical entities that can be genetically modified, observed, and cataloged. These could be plant, animal, or microbial specimens that are subjects of genetic modification.
isOriginOf and originatesFrom: These properties describe a relationship between entities, where one is the origin of the other. In the GMO context, this could relate to how a genetically modified organism originates from a non-modified counterpart or how specific genetic modifications (e.g., inserted genes) originate from certain species or organisms.
Without direct access to the content of your GMO ontology, I'll describe a generic approach to find related pieces:

For PhysicalSample: Look for classes in the GMO ontology that represent specimens or entities subject to genetic modification. This could include classes that denote genetically modified plants, animals, or microorganisms.
For isOriginOf/originatesFrom: Identify properties in the GMO ontology that describe the genetic lineage or the source of genetic material. This could involve relationships between modified organisms and their original genetic sources or the process of genetic modification itself.

PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀isDescribedBy.InformationObject PhysicalSample ⊑ ∀hasProperty.Property""","Based on the information provided about the GMO ontology and the query you're interested in, we can map the query to the concepts and relationships within the GMO ontology by focusing on the PhysicalSample concept, the originatesFrom relationship, and how these elements are modeled in the GMO context. The query you've mentioned aims to find connections where a PhysicalSample originates from another PhysicalSample.

In the GMO ontology, we can interpret this query as looking for instances where a PhysicalSample is derived from another PhysicalSample through a specific process. Based on the detailed description of the GMO ontology module related to PhysicalSample, here's how it aligns with your query:

PhysicalSample and originatesFrom Relationship:
The GMO ontology describes PhysicalSample as a subclass of Feature and explains how a PhysicalSample can be generated from another PhysicalSample or a Feature. This generation process is detailed through the SamplingProcess class, which is a subclass of Event.
The property originatesFrom is used to express the origin of a PhysicalSample from a Feature. In the context of your query, where a PhysicalSample originates from another PhysicalSample, this relationship aligns with the originatesFrom property in the GMO ontology. Specifically, the axiom derivedUsing ◦ isInputFeatureOf− ≡ originatesFrom demonstrates how a PhysicalSample can originate from another through a SamplingProcess.
Related Concepts in GMO Ontology:
PhysicalSample: Defined similarly in both GBO and GMO, representing a physically collected sample that can be cataloged, preserved, or observed.
originatesFrom and derivedUsing: In GMO, the originatesFrom property is directly related to how a sample comes from a feature, aligning with the concept of isOriginOf in GBO. The derivedUsing property and the SamplingProcess class elaborate on how one sample can be derived from another, which aligns with the relationship you're querying for.
Axioms and Properties:
The axioms ∃originatesFrom.Feature ⊑ PhysicalSample and ∃derivedUsing.SamplingProcess ⊑ PhysicalSample specify that a PhysicalSample must originate from a Feature and must be derived through a SamplingProcess. This directly relates to the scenario in your query, where a PhysicalSample (x) originates from another PhysicalSample (z).",FALSE,2/4,0.5,2/4,0.5,,,2/4,0.5,,,,,
